FROM PROBLEMS TO SOLUTIONS |  Economic development is necessary if we want to improve society. There comes a time when the old must give way to the new, and it is not possible to preserve everything from our past as we move towards the future. Finding and keeping the right balance between progress and the protection of cultural sites can be a big challenge.  Big challenges, however, can sometimes lead to great solutions. In the 1950s, the Egyptian government wanted to build a new dam across the Nile in order to control floods, produce electricity, and supply water to more farmers in the area. But the proposal led to protests. Water from the dam would likely damage a number of temples and destroy cultural relics that were an important part of Egypt's cultural heritage. After listening to the scientists who had studied the problem, and citizens who lived near the dam, the government turned to the United Nations for help in 1959.  A committee was established to limit damage to the Egyptian buildings and prevent i the loss of cultural relics. The group asked for contributions from different departments | and raised funds within the international community. Experts investigated the issue, | conducted several tests, and then made a proposal for how the buildings could be saved. Finally, a document was signed, and the work began in 1960.  The project brought together governments and environmentalists from around the world. Temples and other cultural sites were taken down piece by piece, and then moved and put back together again in a place where they were safe from the water. In 1961, German engineers moved the first temple. Over the next 20 years, thousands of engineers and workers rescued 22 temples and countless cultural relics. Fifty countries donated nearly $80 million to the project.  When the project ended in 1980, it was considered a great success. Not only had the countries found a path to the future that did not run over the relics of the past, but they had also learnt that it was possible for countries to work together to build a better tomorrow.  The spirit of the Aswan Dam project is still alive today. Perhaps the best example is shown by UNESCO, which runs a programme that prevents world cultural heritage sites around the world from disappearing. If a problem seems too difficult for a single nation, the global community can sometimes provide a solution.  eco antn  SSS RSS 2 CREA OS TF AA SII  4 UNIT 1 CULTURAL HERITAGE 3 Read the text again and answer the questions.  1 Why did the Egyptian government want to attempt Make a timeline  the building of the dam?

A group of researchers and scientists from China and other countries are working together to help increase knowledge and appreciation of Chinas ancient cultural heritage. They are recording and collecting digital images of cultural relics from the Mogao Caves, which were a key stop along the Silk Road throughout Chinas ancient history. Nearly 500,000 high- quality digital photographs have been produced since the international project started in 1994.  The Mogao Caves have long been a meeting point for different cultures and are part of the history of many countries. Today, the caves are just as international as they were at the time when people travelled the Silk Road. Tourists from all over the world visit Dunhuang to see the caves, and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles has even reproduced a copy of the caves and paintings for people to admire in America.  By sharing so many digital photos over the Internet, the group hopes to promote even wider interest around the world in Chinas ancient history, culture, and traditions. They also hope to further educate people about the importance of safeguarding historic and cultural relics for future generations to understand and appreciate. As one researcher who is working on the project explains, Appreciating ones own cultural heritage is very important for understanding oneself. Appreciating the cultural heritage of other countries is very important for international communication and understanding.  1 What are the researchers and scientists trying to do?

As they learn more about where they come from, they will hopefully tell others about their country and culture. Of course, teachers must _ between teaching the good and bad parts of a countrys history. Learning only the good parts can narrow thinking. Learning the bad parts may help those kinds of things happening again. Students who know their history and culture are more likely to that their cultural heritage is protected, and teachers can motivate students by asking them to come up with their own ideas and make proposals for ways to protect this. One possible idea is for students to raise or money  an organisation or group that protects their countrys cultural heritage. Teachers may also ___ their local museums or historical societies for help in getting students more interested in this important field.  Read the conversation and learn about intangible cultural heritage (ICH). Then complete it with the correct relative pronouns or adverbs.

What do you think the text is about?  2 What do you know about the Tibetan antelope and the Changtang National Nature Reserve?   The air is thin and we have to rest several times on the short hike from camp. To our left, snow-covered mountains disappear into  clouds that seem almost close enough to touch. On the plain  in front of us, we can just make out a herd of graceful animals.  This is why we're hereto observe Tibetan antelopes. }  Tibetan antelopes live on the plains of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai. Watching them move slowly across the green grass, Im struck by their beauty. Im also reminded of the danger they are in. They are being hunted, illegally, for their valuable fur.  My guide is Zhaxi, a villager from Changtang. He works at the Changtang National Nature Reserve. The reserve is a shelter for the animals and plants of northwestern Tibet. To Zhaxi, the land is sacred and protecting the wildlife is a way of life. We're not trying to save the animals, he says. Actually, we're trying to save ourselves.  The 1980s and 1990s were bad times for the Tibetan antelope. The population dropped by more than 50 percent. Hunters were shooting antelopes to make profits. Their habitats were becoming smaller as new roads and railways were built.  In order to save this species from extinction, the Chinese government placed it under national protection. Zhaxi and other volunteers watched over the antelopes day and night to keep them safe from attacks. Bridges and gates were added to let the antelopes move easily and keep them safe from cars and trains.  The measures were effective. The antelope population has recovered and in June 2015, the Tibetan antelope was removed from the endangered species list. The government, however, does not intend to stop the protection programmes, since the threats to the Tibetan antelope have not yet disappeared.  In the evening, | drink a cup of tea and watch the stars. | think about the antelopes and what Zhaxi told me. Much is being done to protect wildlife, but if we really want to save the planet, we must change our way of life. Only when we learn to exist in harmony with nature can we stop being a threat to wildlife and to our planet.  @) 2 Read the text and answer the questions.  Why did the writer visit Tibet?

BY THE INTERNET  Much has been written about the wonders of the World Wide Web. There are countless articles telling us how the Internet has made our lives more convenient. We no longer have to wait in line or carry cash around when we go shopping. We can get the most updated information from large databases. We can download software, documents, and images whenever we need them. But the Internet has done much more for people than simply make life more convenient. Peoples lives have been changed by online communities and social networks.  Jan Tchamani, an English teacher in Birmingham, UK, suddenly developed a serious illness and had to quit her job. At age 50, she found herself out of work and stuck at home with only her computer to keep her company. After a while, she discovered that surfing the Internet could help her feel less lonely and bored. She could listen to music, watch films, play games, and explore the world. She also joined an online group where she could talk about her problems and get support and advice from others. She realised that one of the greatest benefits of the Internet was its ability to remove the distance that usually exists between people.  She was so inspired by the people she met online that she decided to start an IT club to teach older people how to use computers and the Internet. She and her friends now organise events and collect money to pay for private teachers. Many people have been helped by the club. A 59-year-old man learnt how to apply for work online and found a great job. Now that he works and can take care of himself, his daughter has time to study at university. A 61-year-old woman who was living alone has started a small online company together with two friends. She no longer feels lonely, and her company has become quite successful.  Jan has started taking online classes to learn more about how to use the Internet to make society better. She believes that it is highly important to bridge the digital divide and make sure that everyone has access to the Internet and knows how to use new technology. Her next goal is to start a charity website to raise money for children in poor countries.  Jan's life has been greatly improved by the Internet. When you go through tough times, you meet others who are facing similar challenges, Jan says. Thinking about other people's situations inspired me to offer help.  @) 2 Read the text and answer the questions.  Why did Jan quit her job?  How did the people in the online community help her?

Im not an expert, but many years as a blogger have taught me a thing or two.  First of all, theres the golden rule of the Internet: If you see or read something that makes you feel uncomfortable, leave the site immediately. Dont post comments or click on anything.

Being online is no excuse for being rude, and you dont want to become a target for a troll or cyberbully. A troll is a person who posts comments or questions in order to stir up trouble online. Trolls often use several false names so that they can stay on a site. A cyberbully uses the Internet to be mean to others. Like a troll, a cyberbully will also write something mean but it is usually directed at particular people. He or she may also post embarrassing photos and information about those people.

Getting to 4 7p 4nric know a little bit about British history will help ~ NORTH you solve this puzzle. z   In the 16th century, the nearby country of Wales was joined to the Kingdom of England. Later, in the 18th century, the country Scotland was joined to create the Kingdom of Great Britain. In the 19th century, the Kingdom of Ireland was added to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Finally, in the 20th century, the southern part of Ireland broke away from the UK, which resulted in the full name we have today: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Most people just use the shortened name: the United Kingdom or the UK. People from the UK are called British, which means the UK is also often referred to as Britain or Great Britain.  The four countries that belong to the United Kingdom work together in some areas. They use the same flag, known as the Union Jack, as well as share the same currency and military defence. However, they also have some differences. For example, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland all have different education systems and legal systems. They also have their own traditions, like their own national days and national dishes. And they even have their own football teams for competitions like the World Cup!  The United Kingdom has a long and interesting history to explore, which can help you understand much more about the country and its traditions. Almost everywhere you go in the UK, you will be surrounded by evidence of four different groups of people who took over at different times throughout history. The first group, the Romans, came in the first century. Some of their great achievements included building towns and roads. Next, the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the fifth century. They introduced the beginnings of the English  UNIT 4 HISTORY AND TRADITIONS language, and changed the way people built houses. The Vikings came in the eighth century, left behind lots of new vocabulary, and also the names of many locations across the UK. The last group were the Normans. They conquered England after the well-known Battle of Hastings in the 11th century. They had castles built all around England, and made changes to the legal system. The Normans were French, so many French words slowly entered into the English language.  There is so much more to learn about the interesting history and culture of the United Kingdom. Studying the history of the country will make your visit much more enjoyable. The capital city London is a great place to start, as it is an ancient port city that has a history dating all the way back to Roman times. There are countless historic sites to explore, and lots of museums with ancient relics from all over the UK. The UK is a fascinating mix of history and modern culture, with both new and old traditions. If you keep your eyes open, you will be surprised to find that you can see both its past and its present.  3 Read again and sort out the information according to the timeline.  When? What happened?

And down by the sea, the roar of the ocean waves and cries of the seabirds make up the music of the coast. On a quiet morning in the mountains, feel the sun on your skin, and breathe in the sweet scent of fresh flowers while birds greet the new day with their morning song. With all this beauty, it is not surprising that Ireland has developed strong traditions that include music, dancing, and dining.

These videos are uploaded onto the Internet, and then they are put together into one video that you can see onlinea virtual choir. Anyone can take part in a virtual choir from anywhereall you need is a video camera and an Internet connection. You do not even need a studio. A virtual choir helps connect ordinary people together. Many people do not have close friends or contacts who have the same interest in music. Many others do not have the chance to join a local choir. A virtual choir enables them to add their voices to those of other individuals and become part of the global community. It has proved to be a positive influence on the lives of many people. As one virtual choir member said, Music helps me to ... forget my problems. With music, I become someone else.  The virtual choir was the idea of award-winning composer and conductor Eric Whitacre. Born in the USA on 2 January 1970, Whitacre began studying music at the University of Nevada in 1988. He fell in love with Mozarts classical music when he sang for the university choir. Moved by this music, he said, It was like seeing color for the first time. He graduated from university in 1995, and then received a masters degree in musical composition from the Juilliard School in New York in 1997. Over the next 10 years, Whitacres original compositions began to become quite popular among choirs and singers. This led to the creation of the virtual choir.  In 2009, Whitacre received a video of a girl who was singing one of his works. Inspired, he asked his fans to make videos, which he then joined together into one performance. His first virtual choir, Lux Aurumque, had 185 singers from 12 different countries. It has received millions of views on the Internet. Since then, the virtual choir has become a worldwide phenomenon. Whitacres next effort was the Virtual Youth Choir for UNICEF, which was first seen on stage on 23 July 2014 in the UK. Altogether, 2,292 young people from 80 countries joined in to sing Whitacres song What If.

He started his musical training when he was five years old, and his teachers worked him so hard that he often cried. He started writing music when he was nineteen, and two years later he moved to Vienna to study music and perform. Beethoven first became famous as a pianist. However, by 1800, his musical works were so popular that he was thought of by many as the most important composer of his generation. During this same period, he slowly became deaf. Even though he could not hear with his ears, he could still write music because he could hear music in his head. Most of his greatest musical works were completed after he became deaf. In the later part of his life, he had many health and money issues. He was also lonely because the woman he loved and wanted to marry had left him. His friends tried to help him through his dark times, but his life became marked by sadness. He died after a long illness in 1827.

NEW DISCOVERIES FROM THE PAST  Few discoveries are as dramatic as finding the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic or Machu Picchu in the mountains of Peru. But that does not mean that studying history and cultural relics is boring or slow. In fact, exciting new discoveries from the past are made every year. Read the news reports below to learn more about a few recent finds.  Relics from Ancient Greek Ship Rescued  Athens, 8 October 2014, Relics on a Greek ship that sank more than 2,000 years ago have been rescued by an international team of archaeologists and divers. Several artefacts, including a large bronze spear, were found. The ship, which rests 55 metres below the surface, was first discovered in 1900 by local divers. Because the water is so deep, it has been very difficult to examine the ship. Earlier this year, scientists were able to use a robot to photograph and make a map of the wreck. The cultural relics which were then rescued by the international team are among the most important to date and will help answer some of the questions about the history of the ship. A lot of work has to be done at this site to uncover its secrets, said the leader of the team.  Han Dynasty Treasures to Visit the Capital Beijing, 25 February 2016, Beijing's Capital Museum will host some 400 rare cultural relics from the Han Dynasty that have been found in Jiangxi Province during the last five years. The relics were chosen from more than 20,000 pieces and include objects made of gold and other metals. Visitors will have a chance to see beautiful works of art as well as pottery and horse chariots ( 1946 @ & ). The relics were found in the tomb of Haihunhou, where experts have been digging since 2011. According to one of the experts, the find is very unusual, and special measures will be taken to safeguard the objects: We will make sure they are not damaged. The exhibition will open in March and last for three months. = UNIT1 CULTURAL HERITAGE   2 Work in pairs.

Since then, more than 800 cultural sites that are thought to be of special importance to human history and culture have been added to the World Cultural Heritage Site List. The Taj Mahal (4 4 %)in India and the Imperial Tombs of the Qing and Ming Dynasties in China are two of the best known examples.  The Taj Mahal, which was built between 1631 and 1648, is a masterpiece of architecture. It took more than 20,000 workers and 1,000 elephants to complete the project, and the stones came from as far away as China.  Building the Taj Mahal was a labour of love. In the early 17th century, India was ruled by an emperor named Shah Jahan who was married to a woman named Mumtaz. The emperor loved his wife so much that when she died, he built the Taj Mahal in her memory. The beautiful mausoleum was designed to look like what the emperor hoped would be Mumtazs home in the afterlife. The colour of the buildings appears to change with the light of day. Shah Jahan was later buried next to Mumtaz, and the couple now rest together forever.  If the Taj Mahal is a celebration of the heart, then the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are a monument to the mind and spirit. Visitors who walk among the buildings can feel both the weight of history and a wonderful sense of peace.  What makes the Qing and Ming Tombs unique even among amazing buildings such as the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat (%#F @), and the Cologne Cathedral (   )is that they bring together architecture and philosophy. Built by several emperors between 1368 and 1915 in Beijing, Hubei, Hebei, and Liaoning, the Imperial Tombs represent Chinese cultural and historical values that have been handed down from generation to generation for thousands of years.  Human life lasts only a short time but art and culture last forever. The UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites programme attempts to protect and preserve the best of human history. Masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties remind us of what we can achieve at our finest, and inspire us to live up to our great past in the future.  66 UNIT 2  Using Words and Expressions  1  Look at the underlined word(s) in each sentence and choose the most similar meaning.  1  Mass extinction is caused by hunting, habitat loss, and pollution.

THE STRANGE TALE OF THE MILU DEER  The milu deer, one of Chinas most beloved animals, is also one of its strangest. How else could you describe a creature that has the face of a horse, the hoofs of a cow, the antlers of a red deer, and the tail of a donkey?  The history of the species is nearly as strange as its body. The milu deer used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer, they lived together and ate grass  _ as well as the soft parts of trees, such as small branches. However, milu deer were often hunted for food or sport in the past. The Ming and Qing dynasties did not protect them and many were killed. In 1900, the milu deer disappeared from China.  However, before all the deer were killed in China, some were taken to Europe. The Duke of Bedford from Britain collected all the milu deer from Europe and put them in his deer park. The deer liked the cool, wet weather in England, and their numbers increased year by year. In 1985, 20 milu deer were reintroduced from Britain to China and placed in the Beijing Nanhaizi Milu Park in southern Beijing. The next year another herd of 39 arrived from the UK to the Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve in Jiangsu Province.  The milu deer certainly seemed happy to be back in China because their numbers started to grow steadily. There were soon so many of them that 64 milu deer were sent to a newly opened reserve in Shishou, Hubei Province from Beijing in the 1990s. They can move freely in the reserve, feed entirely on wild plants, and continue to safely thrive.  At the moment, the milu deer are still living in reserves where they are being protected and cared for. As a result, their population is now recovering fast. Soon a new chapter will be added to the strange tale of these special animals. The deer are being trained to survive outside the park so that they can one day all return to the wild. The rescue of the milu deer is already a success story. Now it is up to us to make sure that the deer live happily ever after.  70 UNIT 2 WILDLIFE PROTECTION   2 Answer the questions.

What could be done to let people know about the situation?  Dear Sir/Madam,  71   WORKBOOK = -   * Expanding Your World URBAN WILDLIFE  Cities are diverse ecosystems. In addition to visitors from the wild, such as coyotes (  ) in Los Angeles or boars ( 2f# ) in Berlin, a large number of species share our urban areas. As our cities spread, we need to think about what it is like for other species to have human  neighbours.  Because cities are built for humans, they do not always provide suitable habitats for wildlife. For example, most city parks are kept neat and tidy so that humans will find them beautiful. But when we cut grass or plant flowers, we destroy natural habitats.  Our actions sometimes help other species. When  a bridge in Austin, Texas was repaired, engineers added small gaps running along the length of its bottom. This made a good home for bats, and soon the bridge was the home of thousands of bats. At first, people were afraid of the bats and tried to get rid of them. Now, they have come to value their winged neighbours. The bats are a tourist attraction, and they eat lots of bugs every night.  There are also structures built with the objective of bringing wildlife into the city. The Beijing Olympic Forest Park is a good example. The park used native plants and created open, natural spaces for wildlife. The result is a zone in Beijing with over 160 species of birds. In many ways, the park is the opposite of a zoo. Instead of being kept in cages, wildlife can move about freely.  Another example is a 2011 proposal for a tall Birdscraper building in New York. The building is intended to protect birds and fight pollution at the same time. It would be in the middle  of a lake, birds would sit on it, and their droppings would fall into the water. The droppings would feed water plants which would then create oxygen through photosynthesis (   ).  If we learn to share our space, we can become better neighbours to the wildlife around us. If we do not, more species will become extinct and our own future will be endangered.  72 UNIT 3  Using Words and Expressions  1  Learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of the Internet.

There are different kinds of online courses, but most show a video of a teacher and students in a classroom. Students watch the video online and take part in online activities. Some courses are free and open to anyone, giving students anywhere the chance to study at any time. Of course, watching students and teachers on a computer screen is not the same as taking part in a real class.  Other kinds of e-learning are being tested around the world. In Singapore, eight schools have been chosen to try new ways of using technology in the classroom. The schools have tablets and touchscreens instead of books and blackboards in the classrooms. There are also social media platforms to help the students work together on projects, and online worlds where the students can interact with each other and the digital environment while completing different learning tasks.  In South Korea, some students have been taught English by teachers in the Philippines and other countries since 2011. The teachers are in their home countries and are connected to the Korean classrooms via the Internet. Instead of looking at a screen, the students interact with a robot in the classroom. The robot is controlled by the teacher and can move around the classroom and talk with the students. It is unlikely that robot teachers will replace real teachers, but like online learning environments, they can be useful tools.  These important examples show us that e-learning can be successful. Thanks to technology, more and more ways of teaching and learning are being developed. Nobody knows what the classroom of the future will look like, but one thing is for surethere has never been a more interesting time to be a student.  78 UNIT4  Using Words and Expressions  1 Study the words in bold.

Oo O  HOR O OR OeO AO  oO  @ 5 @7.@)  One  O20  Samovarthe Special Teapot  Hello, my speech today is about a very special teapot the samovar! Its a traditional Russian water boiler that can also brew tea. It played a big part in Russian history and was a central part of Russian family life for a very long time. | know this because there is a very old samovar in my home that we treasure dearly. It belonged 3 ; to my great-grandmothers great-grandmother, and the story of how she bought it has been passed down from generation to generation along with the samovar. So let me tell you how this samovar became part of our family.  Almost 200 years ago, my great-grandmothers great-grandmother was trying to survive yet another freezing Russian winter when she heard about a new invention called a samovar, which means self-boiler in Russian. In her family, they could only boil water on their big stove. The new samovar could make hot water much easier and could be transported anywhere, not to mention that it required much less fuel. Although they were poor, they decided to use their savings to invest in a samovar. So early one cold winter morning, she set out to a distant town. After four hours of struggling through snow, she found the town and quickly bundled her new samovar into her sack and hurried home. The samovar was then proudly placed in her main room and has been in use by my family ever since.  The samovar tea-making process is quite special and has two stages. First, a teapot containing lots of tea leaves and a little water is placed on top of the samovar. As the samovar heats up, the teapot begins to produce a strong tea concentrate. Next, the tea concentrate is poured into cups, after which water from inside the samovar is added by using the tap. In contrast to special tea ceremonies that can be found in countries like China, the samovar is much less reserved and is traditionally enjoyed with a few sweet snacks. This is a little similar to the British tradition of an informal cup of tea served with snacks. However, with the samovar, tea is usually taken without milk, and sugar is not placed in the cup but rather in the drinkers mouth, to be slowly melted away by the warm tea.  In closing, in my opinion, regardless of how it is made, one thing is for sure: Tea makes the world go round! Invented in China, it breaks through cultural barriers and provides great relief after a hard days work. Every time we have a special occasion in my family, out comes the family samovar. The samovar symbolises happiness, and thats one thing that | want to keep in my family forever! UNIT 5   Using Words and Expressions  1  Fill in the blanks with words related to music.

Most people recognise the music John Williams wrote for the film Jaws. As soon as you hear it, you begin thinking that a shark will attack. And that is exactly what you are meant to think. On the big screen, Jaws is a scary film. However, if you watch it without the music, it becomes boring. The music tells you to be frightened about what you are seeing. Good film scores always signal how to feel about what is happening on the screen. This is even clearer with Williams next score, for Star Wars. When Luke Skywalker appears on the screen, the music becomes heroic because he is the hero. Darth Vader is the bad guy, so his music is quite dark. Would you think that Luke Skywalker was still a hero without the music? Probably. However, the music makes him seem even more heroic.  No one can talk about film scores without talking about Hans Zimmer. He did the music for many films, such as The Dark Knight, Inception, Pirates of the Caribbean, Gladiator, and The Lion King. Zimmer and Williams have very different styles and ideas for film scores. There are people who do not like Williams scores for the Harry Potter films because they stand out too much, while some people do not like Zimmer's scores because they sometimes do not stand out enough. Of course, in many ways, that is not the point. When you leave a film, you should not be saying, Wow! Great music! Instead, you should be saying, Wow! Great film!  A third, very different kind of film composer is Tan Dun, who has a classical music background, unlike many film composers. Tan started out as a musician for the Peking Opera. However, he fell in love with Western classical music, and started writing classical Western operas that show a strong touch of Chinese music. Like his operas, the scores for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Hero use Chinese musical instruments and styles in a Western classical music score. The music follows all of the rules of most film scores the purpose is to tell you how to feel about the action in the film, and to help tell the story. However, perhaps because of Tans background in classical music, his scores can stand alone as works of art without needing a film to support them.  Film scores are almost always a form of classical music. However, unlike most classical music, they have never been considered high art. Perhaps with Tan Dun, this will begin to change.  90 Appendices  Notes   Unit 1  There comes a time when the old must give way to the new, and it is not possible to preserve everything from our past as we move towards the future.
