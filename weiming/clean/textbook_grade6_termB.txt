Different animals have different ways.  Some animals collect their winter food in the autumn. In the winter, they just stay at home and eat the food they collect in the autumn. For example, squirrels collect seeds and nuts, and beavers collect sticks.  Many birds cannot find food in the winter, so they fly from the north to the south in the autumn. They fly back the next spring. For example, swans and wild geese fly away in the autumn, because they can find food in the warm south.  Some animals sleep for a long time in the winter. They eat a lot of food in the autumn. In the winter, they do not eat anything. They are hungry when they wake up in the spring. They usually look for food  2. in March or April.
