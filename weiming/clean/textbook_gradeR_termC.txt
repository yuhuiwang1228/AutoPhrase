WHY DO WE CELEBRATE FESTIVALS?  Festivals are celebrated all around the world. They have a wide range of origins, such as the seasons of the year, religions, famous figures, and important events. Every festival has its different customs and unique charms. However, no matter how different they may seem, all over the world, the spirit of sharing joy, gratitude, love, or peace is common in all festivals.  Of all the traditional festivals, the harvest festival can be found in almost every culture. This important agricultural festival takes place after all the crops have been gathered in. People celebrate to show that they are grateful for the years supply of food. In ancient Egypt, the harvest festival was celebrated during the springtimethe Egyptian harvest season. It featured a parade and a great feast with music, dancing, and sports. Today, in some European  countries, people decorate churches and town halls with flowers and fruit, and get together to celebrate over a meal. During the Mid-Autumn Festival in China, families gather to admire the shining moon and enjoy delicious mooncakes.  Customs play a significant role in festivals, but sometimes they can change over time. With the development of modern society and the spread of new ideas, some traditions may fade away and others may be established. One example is the typical Chinese Spring Festival custom of lighting firecrackers to drive away the evil spirits and celebrate the new year. Nowadays, many big cities have given up this custom in order to avoid air pollution. Another example is Halloween, which slowly became an exciting festival for children, in spite of its religious origins.  4 UNIT 1 FESTIVALS AND CELEBRATIONS Festivals are becoming more and more commercial, with businesses taking advantage of the celebrations. Online shopping websites and social media apps have made it much easier for the public to spend more on gifts for their loved ones. Although some believe festivals should not be commercialised, others believe the increase in spending is good for the economy and public happiness.  Festivals are an important part of society. They reflect peoples wishes, beliefs, faiths, and attitudes towards life. They are occasions that allow us to relax and enjoy life, and forget about our work for a little while. They help us understand where we came from, who we are, and what to appreciate. And if you study festivals carefully, you may be surprised to find that different cultures actually have a lot in common after all.

MY AMAZING NAADAM EXPERIENCE  | experienced the Naadam Festival in Chinas Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for the first time this year. The festival falls on the fourth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, usually lasting for three days. Naadam means games in Mongolian, and it is represented by three events: horse racing, wrestling, and archery, which are all so exciting to watch!  On the first day, | set off to the games early with my friend Burin. | saw a lot of people wearing fancy Mongolian robes. Some were feeding their horses, some were practising archery, and others were chatting or taking photographs. Burin told me that Mongolians travel every year from near and far to attend the festival, just as their ancestors had done for centuries.  After the opening ceremony and some amazing performances, the wrestling competition began. Mongolian wrestling is different from the wrestling in the Olympic Games. There are no rounds, and wrestlers are not separated by weight. The wrestler loses if any part of his body above his knee touches the ground. After singing some songs, the competitors danced onto the green field, waving their arms in the air as if they were eagles. | was quite moved by their show of strength and grace.  | absolutely enjoyed the archery, too, but the horse races were my favourite part. However, | was surprised to see that the riders were boys and girls! | heard it is because children are lighter and the horses can run faster and farther. At first, | was a little worried about the childrens safety, but Burin said, Dont worry. They've been riding horses all their lives. They'll be just fine. That was the moment | started to understand why people say Horses are at the heart of Mongolian culture. ...

Underline the sentences about  these choices.  2 What were the results of her choices?  3 What does the author want to illustrate by mentioning Dr Lins life choices?  MOTHER OF TEN THOUSAND BABIES  Lin Qiaozhi (1901 1983)  Life is precious. ... To a person nothing is more precious than their life, and if they entrust me with that life, how could I refuse that trust, saying Im cold, hungry, or tired? These words of Dr Lin Qiaozhi give us a look into the heart of this amazing woman, and what carried her through a life of hard choices.  As a five-year-old girl, Lin Qiaozhi was deeply affected by her mothers death. At age 18, instead of following the traditional path of marriage like  " the majority of girls, she chose to study medicine.  Why should girls learn so much? Finding a good husband should be their final goal! her brother complained, thinking of the high tuition fees.  _ She responded, Id rather stay single to study all  my life!  Eight years later, Lin graduated from Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) with the Wenhai  Scholarship, the highest prize given to graduates. She immediately became the first woman ever to be hired as a resident physician in the OB-GYN department of the PUMC Hospital. Within six months, she was named a chief resident physician, a position that usually took four years to achieve. After working for a few years, she was sent to study in Europe and then, in 1939, in the US. She greatly impressed her American colleagues, who invited her to stay. Dr Lin, however, rejected the offer. She wanted to serve the women and children at home.  In 1941, Dr Lin became the first Chinese woman ever to be appointed director of the OB-GYN department of the PUMC Hospital, but just a few months later, the department was closed because of the war. Thinking of all the people still in need of help, Dr Lin opened a private clinic. She charged very low fees to treat patients and often reduced costs for poor patients. At times she was even seen riding a donkey to faraway villages to provide medical care.  UNIT 2 MORALS AND VIRTUES The new Peoples Republic of China saw Dr Lin Qiaozhi playing a key role. In 1954, she was elected to the first National Peoples Congress and, over the next several decades, she held many important positions. Her heart, however, was elsewhere. She was more interested in tending patients, publishing medical research on care for women and children, and training the next generation of doctors. The OB-GYN department cares for two lives, she told new staff in her department. As doctors, we should be responsible for the patients and treat them as our sisters.  Though Lin Oiaozhi never married, she was known as the mother of ten thousand babies, having delivered over 50,000 babies in her lifetime. Dr Lin did not retire until the day she died, 22 April 1983. Since she had no children of her own, she left her savings to a kindergarten and a fund for new doctors. And even as she lay dying, her final thoughts were for others. Im ready to go, she said. Dont try to rescue me any more. Dont waste the medicine any more.  3 Read the text again and answer the questions.

In 1938, Bethune left for China, after he heard that many people were dying in the war. Despite the difficult situation, Dr Bethune did whatever he could to assist the Chinese people. He helped to organise hospitals, taught doctors and nurses, and showed people how to give first aid. Sadly, Dr Bethune passed away in November the following year and was buried in Shijiazhuang. After Dr Bethunes death, Chairman Mao Zedong wrote an article in memory of him, in which he praised Dr Bethune as a hero to be remembered in China.  18 UNIT 2 MORALS AND VIRTUES Listening and Talking  Talk about the importance of kindness  O 4  Listen to a radio show and answer these questions.  1 What is the name of the radio show? 2 What does paying it forward mean? 3 What does the guest want the listeners to do?

THE STONE IN THE ROAD  Once upon a time there was a king who often thought, Nothing good can come to a nation whose people only complain and expect others to solve their problems. One day, he had an idea.  Early one morning, the king disguised himself and went to a local village. He placed a large stone in the middle of the main street and hid gold coins under the stone. Then he hid behind a huge maple tree and watched.  The first person down the street was a milkman with his cart. He crashed into the stone, spilling the milk everywhere. What fool put this stone here?" he shouted. He picked himself up and angrily went away.  After a while, a group of women came along, each balancing a pot of water on her head. One woman tripped over the stone and her water pot went crashing to the ground. She picked herself up and limped away in tears. Neither she nor her friends thought about moving the stone out of the road.  The king watched all day as many people complained about the stone, but he found nobody making an attempt to move it. The king was in despair. Is there no one in this village who feels any responsibility to keep their neighbours from harm?"  Just then, the king saw a young girl coming along. She was the daughter of a local farmer. She had been working all day and was very tired. But when she saw the stone, she said to herself, This stone is a danger to anyone who comes down the street after dark. I'll move it out of the way."  The girl pushed the stone with all her might. After a great deal of effort, she finally succeeded in moving it to the side of the street. Imagine her surprise when she saw the gold coins where the stone had been!  Just then, the king stepped out from behind the tree. Oh sir," the girl said, does this gold belong to you? If not, we surely must find the owner, for he will certainly miss it."  The king said, My dear, the gold is mine. I put it in the road and moved the stone _ over it. Now the gold is yours, because you are the only person who has learnt the lesson I wanted to teach my people."  20 UNIT 2 MORALS AND VIRTUES 2 This story presented different peoples emotions and responses when they came across the same problem.

To earn a living, some opened up shops and restaurants in Chinatown. Many others found jobs on farms, joined the gold rush, or went to build the railway that joined California to the eastern region of the country. The museum did a really good job of showing how America was built by immigrants from different countries and cultures.

WELCOME TO CHINATOWN!  The Chinatown in San Francisco is the biggest in America, and also the oldest. It is a very popular tourist draw that receives more visitors each year than even the Golden Gate Bridge. The climate is mild all year round, meaning it is always a good time to visit.  Historically, Chinese immigrants settled in the area during the railroad construction and gold rush period. What started as a residential area for Chinese immigrants then turned into a centre for Chinese culture. The majority of residents in Chinatown are still ethnic Chinese, many of whom do not speak English fluently. This allows visitors to experience a real taste of China.  Most of Chinatown was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, but the city and residents rebuilt it, taking care to include lots of Chinese architecture. Traditionally, visitors enter Chinatown through the legendary Dragon Gate, which was built using materials donated from China. Other famous sites include the Tin How Temple and Bank of Canton, to name but a few. : Visitors can also spend hours just exploring the interesting sights, smells, and sounds of China. Portsmouth Square is also a key site, being the centre of Chinatown. It has a long and famous history, with the author Robert Louis Stevenson having spent much time writing there. These days, the square is a great place to see traditional Chinese Culture in real life, such as games of Chinese chess, and people practising tai chi.  The stores in the Chinatown offer a unique range of souvenirs, goods, and clothing. All kinds of traditional Chinese herbal medicine can be found, too, and there are Chinese tea stores, where visitors can taste and buy varieties of Chinese tea.  But perhaps what many tourists and San Franciscans treasure most about Chinatown is its food. There is Chinese food to suit everyone's taste, with traditional dishes from all over China.  Chinatowns are an important part of the diverse culture of the USA. They allow visitors who have never been to China to experience traditional Chinese culture first hand.  32 UNIT 3 DIVERSE CULTURES 2 Study the organisation and language features.  1 What information is included in the introduction?

Looking up at the stars, people have always wanted to learn more about space, and scientists work hard to find answers. They make vehicles to carry brave people into space to find out the secrets of the universe.  Before the mid-20th century, most people felt travelling into space was an impossible dream. However, some scientists were determined to help humans realise their dream to explore space. soe Po = On 4 October 1957, the Sputnik 1 satellite was launched by the USSR and successfully orbited around Earth. Afterwards, the USSR focused on sending people into space, and on 12 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person in the world to go into space. Over eight years later, on 20 July 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, famously saying, Thats one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind. Following this, many more goals were achieved. For example, Americas NASA space agency launched Voyager 1 on 5 September 1977 to study deep space, and it still transmits data today.  agi RES Sas x Apolie#t Mooittanding =  i All the astronauts on the USSR's Soyuz 11 and Mr Americas Challenger died during their missions.  3 Use your own words to summarise the main idea for each paragraph. |  Paragraph 1:  Paragraph 2:  Paragraph 3:  Paragraph 4:  Paragraph 5:  4 What does the title Space: The Final Frontier mean to you?

Despite the huge risks though, people will always continue to explore this final f so as to learn its secrets.  These disasters made everyone sad and disappointed, but the desire to explore the universe never died. This is because people believe in | the importance of carrying on space exploration despite the huge risks. An example of this ongoing work is the International Space Station. It orbits Earth and has astronauts from different countries on board, providing a continuous human presence in space.  Challenger after the accident _  Chinas space programme started later than those of Russia and the US, but it has made great progress in a short time. China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space in 2003, when Yang Liwei successfully orbited Earth in the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft. Then Shenzhou 6 and 7 completed a second manned orbit and the first Chinese spacewalk, followed by the vehicle Jade Rabbit being sent to the moon to study its surface. After that, China launched the Tiangong 2 space lab into space and Tianzhou 1 to dock with it. This signalled one step further in Chinas plan to establish a space station in the future. More recently, China has sent Change 4 to explore the surface of the far side of the moon to make measurements and observations.  Europe, the US, and China all have plans to further study and explore planets like Mars and Jupiter. Despite the difficulties, scientists hope future discoveries will not only enable us to understand how the universe began, but also help us survive well into the future.

IS EXPLORING SPACE A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY?  i Se =  NASA satellite image of Typhoon Goni  Countries around the globe are spending billions |  of dollars and lots of time on various space missions, whether to Mars or other planets much further away. Some people argue that we should stop wasting time and money exploring space. Instead, we should feed the worlds poor and find immediate solutions to other problems, such as pollution and fatal diseases. However,  others feel this is a shallow view which fails to |  realise how exploring space helps us.  Firstly, exploring space has already made a  | difference in the fight against world hunger. It | has directly resulted in the many satellites that |  now orbit Earth. A number of the satellites record data on land and weather patterns.  Then the data is transmitted to scientists on |  Earth. After careful analysis, the scientists can provide useful recommendations and  . | advice for farmers. As a result, space-based  science has helped farming in its efforts to grow enough food to feed Earths increasing population.  UNIT 4 SPACE EXPLORATION  Secondly, space exploration has already promoted technological improvements that benefit us all. High-end products around the world are made to a higher standard now because of advanced technology which was first created to meet the requirements for space exploration. For example, space technologies have helped the research and development of different types of new material. They have also helped companies make better heart monitors and other machines that doctors regularly use. Today, space technologies are widely used in all kinds of industries, and everyday products such as GPS, memory foam pillows, and smartphone cameras are changing our lives.  Finally, sending astronauts into space has helped people to think about the worlds problems and even to find ways to solve them. Seeing pictures of our planet as an island in a black sea made people realise that our planets resources are limited. In order to provide for such a rapidly increasing population, scientists are trying to find other planets that could one day be our new home. The greatest attention at present is on Mars because it is closer to Earth. In the future, humans may live on both planets.  In closing, exploring space provides the world with many different benefits. Therefore, it should continue so as to provide new and better solutions to peoples short-term and long-term problems. 1 Why are some people against space exploration?  2 What has space exploration done for food production?  3 What did the pictures of Earth from space make people realise?  4 How does space exploration benefit the products that people use nowadays?  2 Study the organisation and language features.  1 Read the first paragraph and underline the different opinions about space exploration.  2 Find the three topic sentences that summarise the writers arguments about space exploration.  3 Underline the sentence that repeats the writers opinion in the last paragraph.  3 Use what you have learnt to write about your opinion about space exploration. 1 Are these arguments for or against exploring space?

Later,  the US succeeded, and Neil Armstrong became the first man onto the moon. During the first moon landing, astronauts had no vehicles , So they had to explore the moon on foot. On the fourth mission on the moon, astronauts took  a lunar vehicle so that they could explore places further away.  3 Astronauts must wear spacesuits when they work in space because there is no air and it can be very cold outside the spacecraft. While , they must attach themselves to something so as floating around.  4 The accident on the Apollo 13 spacecraft resulted in a loss of oxygen, water, and electrical power.

THE CHINESE SPRING FESTIVAL  The Chinese Spring Festival is regarded as the most significant festival of the year among the Chinese. It lasts for 15 days but Chinese people also consider the days of preparation beforehand as an important part of the Spring Festival.  There are a number of things people usually do before the Chinese Spring Festival. One of these is cleaning the house for the Lunar New Year. Dust makes people think of old or outdated things. Therefore, sweeping dust out of the house is a way of saying goodbye to old things and welcoming new things. Another important custom for families is to decorate their doors with red couplets. The phrases on the couplets express hopes for a prosperous new year. In the southern part of China, people will buy fresh flowers or orange trees to decorate their homes. The most important custom of the Chinese Spring Festival is the big family dinner on the eve of the Lunar New Year. This is usually a big reunion of grandparents, parents, and children. It reflects how important family is to Chinese people around the world. That is why. millions of Chinese people travel long distances to get home before the eve of the Lunar New Year. Also, families typically eat certain types of lucky food at the family reunion dinner. Eating fish, for example, is supposed to bring more wealth and prosperity than one needs, as the pronunciation of fish in Chinese (yu) is also used for surplus.  When the New Year comes, there are many interesting festival activities. Adults give children lucky money in red envelopes. People greet family and friends with Xinnian Hao or Gongxi Facai whenever they may meet. Another part of this custom of sharing good wishes is to pay visits to relatives and bring them gifts. Commonly exchanged gifts include food such as fruit, sticky rice cakes, and homemade desserts. In addition, friends and family go out to enjoy loud and colourful fireworks, spend time at temple fairs, and watch exciting dragon and lion dances.  The Chinese Spring Festival symbolises a farewell to the old year and a warm welcome to the brand new year. More importantly, it is a special occasion to return home and gratefully reunite with family members. This deeply rooted tradition has been an integral part of Chinese culture for a very long time, and will continue to live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people.  64 - UNIT1 FESTIVALS AND CELEBRATIONS    Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 3 Paragraph 4  What are the aims of the festival?

The windows are covered with steam from the heat inside. Outside, the temperature is -32C. Snow covers the streets and is piled up along the sidewalks. The music and the lights of the Quebec Winter Carnival continue, but after a whole day of watching parades, riding in horse carriages, and listening to music, the tourists feet are freezing and their noses are red.  Bonhomme  Every year, hundreds of thousands of people come to Quebec to take part in the week-long winter festival. Everyone who comes must be prepared to keep moving, as it is too cold to stand and watch for long.  Early in the morning, you can watch the snowboarding competition on the hill overlooking the river. Competitors speed down the track and through the air as though they could fly.  The more brave of heart may try the canoe races. Five or six men paddle each canoe across the partly-frozen St Lawrence River. The river is full of big chunks of ice, and if you were to fall in, you would freeze to death in under two minutes.  One of the favourite events is the dog-sled race, in which teams of about six husky dogs pull long sleds at great speeds along a snowy track. One person drives the sled, shouting to the dogs to encourage them. The sound of the dogs barking, the calls of the drivers, and the shouts of the crowd create an exciting northern experience. The dogs are strong and beautiful animals with thick fur, and many have blue eyes.  While admiring the ice sculptures everywhere in the city, much like those in Harbin in China, you can stop off with other tourists in an igloo for hot tea or coffee. It is amazing how warm these ice houses can be!  Later in the evening, you can join the crowd at the Ice Palace, where Bonhomme the snowman is king. You can dance outside to the music of a band, whose members are all dressed in heavy  clotheseven some of their instruments are dressed up for winter.  Finally, you will probably want to sit down in a caf to warm up and plan for the next day. You might want to join the snowmobile racesor maybe you should just sleep in!  i Glues  66  UNIT2 _  Using Words and Expressions  1 Write down the new words from the unit based on the definitions.  1 the relationship between two people who are married a period of ten years  3 a school for children aged two to five  4 an amount of money that you have not spent  5 amoral rule or a strong belief  that influences your actions  6 having a lot of energy or determination  twelve oclock at night  8 the upper part of your legs when you are sitting down  9 to say something very quietly, using your breath rather than your voice  10 the most northern or most southern point on a planet  2 Match the words on the left to the words on the right to make phrases.

The cells in the station were very small, cold, and damp; some did not even have light, but the immigrants had nowhere else to go. Their miserable stay felt like punishment rather than justice and freedom. They wrote poems on the walls about loneliness, and mourned their earlier life in China. The civil authorities reformed the system in 1940, and many more Chinese took the opportunity to settle in the USA.  The visit to Angel Island made me think about my life.

When you think of America, what symbols come to your mind first?  Perhaps one of the most famous symbols of the US is fast food. Fast-food restaurants became popular when people began driving cars around the country. Many of the earliest fast-food restaurants were drive-ins where people ate in their cars while they were parked. However, now drive-throughs have become popular because people need to keep up with the speed of modern life. With a drive-through, you can just drive up to a window, pick up the food, and then drive away. About 20% of all American meals are eaten in the car, and Americans spend about 10% of their income on fast food. No wonder America is called the Fast-Food Nation!  When it comes to seeing a game in person, baseball is by far the most popular sport in America. In a typical year, more people attend baseball games than football and basketball games combined. And for most people, baseball is Americas game in a way that football and basketball are not, because it is a special symbol of the American spirit. For one thing, while baseball is a team sport, every player can be a hero or star. For another, almost anyone can play baseball, even if you do not have great skills or ability. Finally, there is nothing more American than eating a hot dog while watching a baseball game on a hot summer afternoon. Baseball still is the national pastime.  Jazz is often called Americas music. It is a music style completely created in the United States by African American musicians. Jazz music broke through the colour barriers, and has become a key part of American culture. One early jazz pioneer was the trumpet player Louis Armstrong (1901-1971). Perhaps more than any other person, Armstrong helped spread jazz beyond its home in New Orleans to the rest of the United States, and to the world. Jazz musicians freely make up their own music to express their own feelings, even while playing in a group. This freedom and individuality make jazz a popular symbol of America.  There are many other symbols of America, such as the Statue of Liberty, Hollywood, and Broadway. These are but a few symbols that show something of American culture.  76 oe UNIT3 DIVERSE CULTURES  2 Read the text again and answer these questions.

Although the majority of the current population is of European descent, it was the minority group known as the Maori who were the first to settle there. They named the country Aotearoathe Land of the Long White Cloud. Today, both past and present Maori culture can be found all over the country for all welcomed visitors to appreciate.  Maori arts and crafts are world-renowned and very popular with tourists. The Waka is a traditional canoe that has been skillfully carved out of a tree trunk, with beautiful carvings added to show tribal history and culture. A large war canoe could be up to 40 metres long and hold up to 80 people. Visitors to Maori historic buildings, such as tribal meeting halls, can see beautifully carved wooden architecture. In addition, there are countless smaller objects and masks that were made to honour ancestors or legends, or to preserve a story for future generations.  Another well-known part of Maori culture is the traditional kapa haka dancemade famous by New Zealand's national rugby union team, who often perform it before games. The kapa haka is a traditional dance performed for celebrations, special guests, and battle ceremonies. The performance includes different dances and songs that make up a whole. A common dance sequence could be waiata tira (warm-up song), whakaeke (entrance song), waiata- a-ringa (action song), haka (challenge), pou (old-style singing), po/ (ball-swinging), and whakawatea (closing song).  Traditional tattoos, known as moko, are also a strong visual part of Maori culture. They are most often done in spiral forms across  a mans face, and on the chin and lips of a woman. They represent a persons status, and are also believed to increase attractiveness. Receiving moko is seen as a great honour, and it is often part of a ritual to signal a person has passed an important milestone. As such, it is usually added in stages as a person grows older and achieves more, in a sense telling a unique story of a persons life.  There is so much more for visitors to discover about Maori culture. It is an essential part of what makes New Zealand the modern country that it is: a multicultural country that is forever evolving in new and interesting ways.  78 UNIT 4 - SPACE EXPLORATION   Using Words and Expressions  1 Make phrases with the words inthetwo 3 Complete the sentences with the columns and explain their meanings. correct forms of the words in the box.

Humans Terraforming Mars  Some of the worlds most important scientists think the idea of people living on Mars will come true one day. Stephen Hawking believed humans must move into space to survive. Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe, he said. Robert Zubrin, a rocket scientist, agrees and thinks starting with Mars makes the most sense. He thinks sending people to Mars will allow us to learn a lotfor example, about the ability of humans to live in a very different environment.  However, scientists will need to terraform Mars for people to be able to live. Terraforming means changing the environment on a planet so that it is similar to Earths. One of the main goals of terraforming Mars is to warm it up because the average temperature there is about -60C. One idea for warming Mars is to build factories there that produce greenhouse gases. This could take many centuries. However, it should lead to rainfall and the growth of plants, resulting in more air that people can breathe.  Another big concern for scientists is whether humans can move to Mars and still stay healthy in mind and body. As a test, six people lived in a Mars-like environment in Hawaii for a year before returning to Earth recently. It was a 1,200-square-foot room that was on the side of a volcano and used the sun for energy. Christiane Heinicke, one of the people who lived there, said that one of the biggest issues was feeling bored. So humans on Mars would always need to keep themselves busy with various activities. Another important finding was that the people living together should all be able to get along and work together.  One particular organisation based in Europe is planning to send the first humans to Mars before 2030. The organisation believes that its project is giving people worldwide the chance to be part of the first human crew ever to live on Mars for good. However, many experts think the projects cost of US$6 billion is too low for it to be successful. The American space agency NASA believes that sending people to Mars would cost about US$100 billion, although this estimate is based on bringing them back to Earth, too. Regardless, it seems that humans living on Mars may well happen a lot sooner than most people believe.  82 = = - -  - UNIT4 SPACE EXPLORATION  1 What was Stephen Hawkings viewpoint on sending humans to other planets to live? 2 What does terraforming mean?  3 According to the test done in Hawaii, what might be one of the biggest problems for the first humans living on Mars?

The Big Bang Theory is an idea about how our universe began. Many scientists believe that everything in the universe used to be tightly C pressed together. Then this mass of high energy separated into e smaller pieces very quickly about 14 billion years ago to create the universe. At the moment of creation, the universe was extremely hot and everything was very close together. Then it began to spread out and cool. Today, the universe is still getting bigger. The Big Bang is considered to be the beginning of everything; time, space, and all the matter in the universe.  What is the Hubble Space Telescope?  The Hubble Space Telescope is a very powerful telescope  and was put into low orbit around Earth in 1990. Its four main  instruments use a 2.4-metre mirror to look deep into space.  The telescope does not have to deal with the effects of  background light like telescopes on Earth, so it has been able  to take very detailed pictures of space. A big achievement of : the telescope has been to help scientists correctly measure how quickly the universe is expanding.  What is FAST?  Chinas Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope is better known as FAST. Located in Guizhou Province in southwestern China, FAST has been used since 25 September 2016. Its 500-metre dish is the worlds largest single-dish radio telescope. As such, scientists can use it to look for various things in the universe that are very far away. They can also use it to search for signs of communication that are not coming from Earth.

On 16 August 2016, China became the first country in the world to launch a quantum communications satellite into space. A quantum satellite is different from other satellites because it links together very small things, called subatomic particles, and uses them to send and receive information. Unlike other information, this information is completely safe from people who may want to steal it. If anyone tries, the link between the subatomic particles changes and the information becomes unreadable.

My father worked long hours to support our family. We ate the same food every day, saved where we could, and tried our best to keep up appearances. Every Sunday, we would put on our best clothes and go for a walk by the sea. My parents would walk at the back with great dignity. My sisters, both of marriageable age, would stride ahead, hoping to attract the right people. On those days, when we saw the ships returning from distant countries, my father would remark: What a surprise it would be if Jules were on that one! Eh?  My uncle Jules was the black sheep of the family. He had squandered both his inheritance and my fathers, before setting forth for America. There, he set up a business in New York and wrote to say that he would soon repay my father. The news caused a dramatic change. Once regarded as a hopeless case by all, Uncle Jules was now considered a good and honest man, like all the other Davranches. When I am wealthy, I shall return to Havre, he promised in another letter. I hope it wont be too long and that we shall all live happily together.  That letter was pulled out and read at every opportunity. The more time passed, the more hopeful my family became. After all, our dreams were built on the wealth of Uncle Jules.  A few years later, one of my sisters got married to a clerka man whom I suspect to have seen the letterand my family celebrated by going on a rare holiday together. On the ship bound for Jersey, we saw an old man shucking oysters for the passengers. That man looks extraordinarily like Jules, my father muttered to my mother. Astonished, my mother went to take a closer look. She, too, turned pale as a sheet. My father then  asked the captain for more information. The captain said, Hes a tramp whom I met in America. Hes avoiding his family in Havre because he owes them money. I think his name is JulesJules Darmanche or Darvanche, or something like that. : Tts he! What should we do? moaned my father. Z My mother, suddenly furious, exclaimed, I knew that thief would remain useless! What else can we expect from a Davranche! 3 Only the three of us were in the know. Determined to keep it that way, my parents handed me five francs and asked me to pay for the oysters discreetly. How much do we owe you, monsieur? I asked. Two francs fifty, he replied. I handed him the money and received change from his poor wrinkled hand. I looked at his old and unhappy face, and I, too, saw my uncle. Unable to help myself, I gave him back fifty centimes. Thank you so much, young sir! he said gratefully, without recognising me.  ' Are you insane? my mother exclaimed when I returned with two francs. Giving a tip to that  _ man  _ My father pointed at his son-in-law. Everyone fell silent. As we drew closer to Jersey, I wanted desperately to see my Uncle Jules again and to console him with tender words, but he had long disappeared below the deck.  90 Appendices   Notes   Unit 1  Phoenix flutes make music, ... whirl the whole night long.
