One by one, six little yellow ducklings came out of the eggs.  There was still one egg left. The mother duck sat on that egg {{ again. Two days later, out came a duckling. But this duckling wasnt yellow. It was grey, and it had a long, thin neck.  The other ducklings didnt like the grey duckling. They didnt want to play with him. They said he was ugly. The little ugly duckling was sad.  Summer came. The ducklings all grew bigger, and the ugly duckling was the biggest. One day they went to a farm. A chicken bit him, and the farmer kicked him. The ugly duckling felt terrible.  The ugly duckling ran away. He went to the tall grass by the lake to live by himself. He felt lonely every day.  Autumn came. The ugly duckling got bigger and bigger. He swam by himself every day, so he got stronger, too.  Finally, spring came. One day, a little girl came to the lake with her mother.

He played on the school basket- ball team.  On April 12th, 1980, Terry started a special trip across Canada. Every day he ran about 42 kilometres. He ran on rainy days, windy days and hot sunny days. He ran  through small villages and big  cities. Terry ran for 143 days. It wasnt easy, but Terry kept running.  84  A Special Trip  When he was 18, Terry got cancer. The doctors had to take off his leg. Terry never gave up. He learned to walk and run with his new leg. Terry saw so many people sick with cancer in the hospital. He wanted to run across Canada to get money for cancer research.  On September Ist, 1980, Terry felt very sick. His doctors said that he had to stop his trip. Terry was very sad. He wanted to keep running. The people of Canada were very sad, too. They gave more and more money for cancer research. They hoped Terry would get better and would start to run again. Sadly, Terry died on June 28th, 1981. He was 22 years old.  The people of Canada were very proud of Terry. They gave him Canadas highest award. He was the youngest person ever to win this award. In 1999, Canadians named him Canadas greatest hero. Now in Canada, you can see Terrys statue everywhere.  Canadians did not forget Terry. Every September, in many towns and cities  in Canada, there is the Terry Fox Run. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians, young and old, run for Terry. They give money to find a cure for cancer. Since 1981, they have given 300 million dollars.  @ Put the sentences in order.  ) Terry Fox ran for 143 days. ) Terry Fox died on June 28th, 1981.  ) Terry Fox started a special trip.  a a aa  @ Retell the story in groups.  ) Terry Fox was popular and hardworking.  ) Terry Fox got more and more money for cancer research.

I swam in the sea,  I saw many fish,  I bought many gifts,  So I felt good.  I sat on the beach,  I played on the sand,  I ate delicious food,  So I had fun.  Fun Time, C This is my grandpa. He is old,  But he was young like you.  He learned to walk when he was one  and speak when he was two.  He went to school when he was six  and learned to swim at three. Now my grandpas sixty-four,  And now he teaches me.  87 88  HR BLAIR  (4:          )   too much te 42) candy WR (2) go to bed   ; RE (2) early 2 exercise te (2) tired   ;   (2) drink Hs 4K (2) before     (2) dirty   2 ) always Be (2) stomachache HA (4) headache KF (4) toothache F(A) a lot of KE; HS (A) sleepy   ;    (6) subject   (6) mark   (6 ) advice  (6 ) more    (6)  Umit 2 New Years Day   (14 ) Tree Planting Day   (14 ) Mothers Day HY (14) Childrens Day   (14) Fathers Day RHA (14) TeachersDay   (14) National Day   (14) Christmas Day   (14) birthday #8 (14) fifth (Sth)   (14 ) tenth (10th)   (14) twelfth (12th) % f= (14)  twenty-fifth (25th) Bok (14)  plant   (14) make a poster   (16 ) celebrate  (16) have a picnic FH (16 ) office DDE (18) together    ;  (18 ) special   ; 44589 (18) send an email     26 ) write a letter Be (26 ) make a phone call 47 Be (26 ) send a short message     (26 ) mail a present   (26 ) make a video call 47 ALIA IF (26 ) say it; Be (28) makeacard   (28 ) everywhere   ;   30 )   30 )  flower show  cleaned the window (   ) BAT (44) watched TV (   ) ABA (44) climbed a hill (   ) Mb (44) visited grandparents (   )     (44 ) danced  ( dance     )  ( 44 )  jumped rope (   )  (44 ) listened to music    ) HK (44) rowed a boat (   )  (44 ) played computer games (   )      (44 ) stayed at home (   ) RARE (44) played the piano (   )   44 ) played chess (   ) FH (44) washed clothes (   )   45 ) boring   ; 27ka (45)  badminton   (46 ) won (win     )  ;  (48 )  Unit 5 rer Lee Tee eT ee  went to the beach  (32 RA) HH (56) drank cold drinks  (   ) BAR (56)  89 90  swam (swim     )  (56 ) ate ice-cream  (   )   56 )  the Stone Forest  (56 ) bought some gifts     )    56 ) took photos     )   (56 ) saw flowers (   ) HE (56) slept (sleep     ) BEI (57) delicious   ;    58 ) felt happy (   )    58 ) Sad aR;   (60 ) left (leave     ) BA (60)      (60 ) are     )  60 )  French fries  were  was born     ) HA (68)  started to speak (   )    68 ) learned to walk (   ) FAB (68) learned to ride a bike (   )     68 ) went to kindergarten (   )    68 ) went to school (3st 5A) LF (68) learned to swim (   )   68 ) fifteenth (15th) #%+2 (68) started to buy things (   )     (70 ) started to study English (   )    (70) started to use a computer (SEEK )     70 )   ;   72 ) BA (RS) (72) into  ; Bec  (72) RF (72) wet       (72 )  all over  out of  chopsticks By RS      (  :          )  alot of KE; 7 (30) advice  (6 ) all over   ;   72 ) always Bx (2)  ate ice-cream  (   )     56 )    46 ) before     2) birthday zB (14) boring   ; ZRH) (45) bought some gifts  (   ) FFL (56)  badminton  candy  (2 ) celebrate  (16 ) Childrens Day JL# 77 (14) chopsticks RF (72)  Christmas Day #7677 (14) cleaned the window  (   ) RAT (44)  climbed a hill (at KA) Merb (44)  danced (dance     ) BEI (44)  delicious    ; TIA (58) dirty    (2 ) drank cold drinks  (   )    56 ) drink  ;  (2)  early Fe (209) everywhere   ;   (30) exercise HT (2 )  Fathers Day   (14) felt happy  (HAA)    58 ) fifteenth (1Sth)    (68 ) fifth (5th)   (14 )  91 flower show 70% (30) French fries    (60)  go to bed   ; WR (2)   16 ) KF (4)  have a picnic headache  jumped rope  (   )  (44)  learned to ride a bike (   )     (68 ) learned to swim (   )   (68 ) learned to walk (   )   (68) left (leave     )  (60) listened to music     ) HR (44)  maila present   (26 )   (28 )  make a phone call  make a card  47 Wie (26 )  make a poster   (16) make a video call  47 PLINY TE (26 )  mark   (6) more    (6 ) Mothers Day thee (14)  National Day   (14) New Years Day   (14 )  office    (18 )  out of BA (a) (72)  plant   (14 ) played chess (at AA) FH (44) played computer games    ) HBF BRM (44) played the piano (it LA ) PAAR (44 ) rowed a boat  (   )  (44 )  Sad   ;   60 ) saw flowers    ) KE (56) say  ; BE (28 ) send a short message     (26) send an email     26 ) sleepy   ;    (6) slept ( sleep     )  (57 ) special   ;   (18 ) started to buy things (   )      (70 ) started to speak (   )    ( 68 ) started to study English (   )    (70 ) started to use a computer (AA)     (70) stayed at home (   ) RERE (44) A (4)  stomachache  subject   (6) swam (swim     )  (56 )  Teachers Day   (14) tenth (10th) %+ (14) the Stone Forest  (56 )  tired AH;   (2)    ;  (18 ) Re (2)  together too much took photos  (   ) RA (56) toothache Fw (A) Tree Planting Day  Aa (14)  twelfth (12th)    (14 ) twenty-fifth (25th)      :14 )  visited grandparents  (   ) ABBR (44)  93 was born  washed clothes (   ) HAIR (45 ) watched TV    ) AWM (44) went to kindergarten (   )    (68 )  (   ) BE (68)  went to School   )   68  went to the beach (   )   56 ) were are     )  (60)  wet       (72) won (win     )  ;  RIE (48) write a letter Bs (26)                                      ( 2011   )                         2013                                                                                                                                     oe.
