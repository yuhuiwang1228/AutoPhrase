Why did Wei Fen find it difficult to learn English? 2. What did she do in English class? 3. What is the secret to language learning?  How I Learned to Learn English  Last year, I did not like my English class. Every class was like a bad dream. The teacher spoke too quickly. But I was afraid to ask questions because my pronunciation was very bad. So I just hid behind my textbook and never said anything.  Then one day I watched an English movie called Toy Story. | fell in love with this exciting and funny movie! So then I began to watch other English movies as well. Although I could not understand everything the characters said, their body language and the expressions on their faces helped me to get the meaning. I also realized I could get the meaning by listening for just the key words. My pronunciation also improved by listening to the interesting conversations in English movies. I discovered that listening to something you are interested in is the secret to language learning. I also learned useful sentences like Its a piece of cake or It serves you right. I did not understand these sentences at first. But because I wanted to understand the story, I looked up the words in a dictionary.  Now I really enjoy my English class. I want to learn new words and more grammar. Then I can have a better understanding of English movies.  3b Complete the sentences with what Wei Fen learned from watching movies.

USING DICTIONARIES  This can help you find the definition that matches the context of the word in the text.  How Can You Become a Successful Learner?  Everyone is born with the ability to learn. But whether or not you can do this well depends on your learning habits. Research shows that successful learners have some good habits in common.  Creating an interest in what they learn  Studies show that if you are interested in something, your brain is more active and it is also easier for you to pay attention to it for a long time. Good learners often connect what they need to learn with something they are interested in. For example, if they need to learn English and they like music or sports, they can listen to English songs or watch sports programs in English. This way they will not get bored.  Practicing and learning from mistakes  Good learners think about what they are good at and what they need to practice more. Remember, use it or lose it! Even if you learn something well, you will forget it unless you use it. Practice makes perfect. Good learners are also not afraid of making mistakes. Alexander Graham Bell did not invent the telephone overnight. He succeeded by trying many times and learning from his mistakes.  Developing their study skills  It is not enough to just study hard. You have to know how to study. Good learners find out the best ways to learn well. For example, they may take notes by writing down key words or by drawing mind maps. Good learners also look for ways to review what they have learned. They may do this by reading their notes every day or by explaining the information to another student.  | Asking questions  | Good learners often ask questions during or after class.  | They even ask each other and try to find out the answers. | Knowledge comes from questioning.  Learning is a life-long journey because every day brings something new.

INFERRING  This means you have to read between the lines to get the meanings that are  not clearly stated in a text.  The Spirit of Christmas  Many would agree that when we think of Christmas, we probably think of gifts, Christmas trees and Santa Claus. But behind all these things lies the true meaning of Christmas: the importance of sharing and giving love and joy to people around us. The story in A Christmas Carol is perhaps the best example of this.  A Christmas Carol is a famous novel written by Charles Dickens. It is about an old man named Scrooge who never laughs or smiles. He is mean and only thinks about himself, and doesnt treat others nicely. He just cares about whether he can make more money. And he hates Christmas. One Christmas Eve, Scrooge sees the ghost of Jacob Marley, his dead business partner. Marley used to be just like Scrooge, so he was punished after he died. He warns Scrooge to change his ways if he doesnt want to end up like him. He also tells Scrooge to expect three spirits to visit him.  That night, three ghosts visit Scrooge. First, the Ghost of Christmas Past takes him back to his childhood and reminds Scrooge of his happier days as a child. Then the second spirit the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes him to see how  _ others are spending Christmas this year. Everyone is happy, even poor people. The last one, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, takes him to the future. He sees that he is dead but nobody cares. Scrooge is so scared that he wakes up in his bed and finds out it is already the next morning on Christmas Day!  He decides to change his life and promises to be a better person. He happily celebrates Christmas with his relatives. He also gives gifts to people in need. He now treats everyone with kindness and warmth, spreading love and joy everywhere he goes. And that  is the true spirit of Christmas!  s eeccccccccceseee| think that mooncakes are deliciousls UNIT 2  2c Read the passage again and complete the chart.

Candy told me that she used to be really shy and took up singing to deal with her shyness. As she got better, she dared to sing in front of her class, and then for the whole school. Now shes not shy anymore and loves singing in front of crowds.  2 Iasked Candy how life was different after she became famous. She explained  : that there are many good things, like being able to travel and meet new people all the time. I didnt use to be popular in school, but now I get tons of attention everywhere I go. However, too much attention can also be a bad thing. I always have to worry about how I appear to others and I have to be very careful about what I say or do. And I dont have much private time anymore. Hanging out with friends is almost impossible for me now because there are always guards around me.  : 3 What does Candy have to say to all those young people  : who want to become famous? Well, she begins slowly, you have to be prepared to give up your normal life. You can never imagine how difficult the road to success is. Many times I thought about giving up, but I fought on.

Stonehenge  Can Anyone Explain Why It Is There?  Stonehenge, a rock circle, is not only one of Britains most famous historical places, but also one of its greatest mysteries. Every year it receives more than 750,000 visitors. Especially in June, people go to this place as they want to see the sun rising on the longest day of the year.  For many years, historians believed Stonehenge was a temple where ancient leaders tried to communicate with the gods. However, historian Paul Stoker thinks this cant be true because Stonehenge was built so many centuries ago. The leaders arrived in England much later, he points out.  Another popular idea is that Stonehenge might be a kind of calendar. The large stones were put together in a certain way. On midsummers morning, the sun shines directly into the center of the stones. Other people believe the stones have a medical purpose. They think the stones can prevent illness while keeping people healthy. As you walk there, you can feel the energy from your feet climb up your body, said one visitor. No one is sure what Stonehenge was used for, but most agree that the position of the stones must be for a special purpose. Some think it might be a burial place, or a place to honor ancestors. Others think it was built to celebrate a victory over an enemy.  Stonehenge was built slowly over a long period of time. Most historians believe it must be almost 5,000 years old. One of the greatest mysteries is how it was built because the stones are so big and heavy. In 2001, a group of English volunteers tried to build another Stonehenge, but they couldn't. We dont really know who built Stonehenge, says Paul Stoker. And perhaps we might never know, but we do know they must have been hardworking  and great planners!  . occccccccccccccelt must belong to Carla.cesseeerecccccccccccccccccccce UNIT 8   2c Read the article again and complete the chart.

NOTING SUPPORTING DETAILS  These can be examples, reasons, Sad but Beautiful opinions or other detailed information in each paragraph.  Last night one of my Chinese friends took me to a concert of Chinese folk music. The piece which was played on the erhu especially moved me. The music  was strangely beautiful, but under the beauty I sensed a strong sadness and pain. The piece had a simple name, Moon Reflected on Second Spring, but was one of the most moving pieces of music that Ive ever heard. The erhu sounded like it was crying, and I almost cried along with it as I listened. Later I looked up the history of Moon Reflected on Second Spring, and I began to understand the sadness in the music.  The music was written by Abing, a folk musician who was born in the city of Wuxi in 1893. Just one year later, his mother died. Abings father taught him to play many musical instruments, such as the drums, dizi and erhu, and by age 17, Abing was known for his musical ability. However, after his father died, Abings life grew worse. He was very poor, caught a serious illness and became blind. For several years, he had no home. He lived on the streets and played music to make money. Even after Abing got married and had a home again, he continued to sing and play in the city streets. He performed in this way for many years.  Abings amazing musical skills made him very popular during his lifetime. By the end of his life, he could play over 600 pieces of music, many of which he wrote himself. It is a pity that only six pieces of music in total were recorded for the future world to hear, but his popularity continues to this day. Today, Abings Moon Reflected on Second Spring is a piece which all the great erhu masters play and praise. It has become one of Chinas national treasures. Its sad beauty not only paints a picture of Abings own life but also makes people recall their deepest wounds from their own sad or painful experiences.   eeccccccccceseee| like music that! can dance to, seeeecccccccccccccccccce UNIT 9   Read the passage again and use suitable words to complete the main idea of each paragraph.

REVIEWING  Taking notes or summarizing the main ideas can help you move language from your short-term to long-term memory.  Dear Laura,  Thanks for your message. Yes, Im having a great time on my student exchange program in France. I was a bit nervous before I arrived here but there was no reason to be. My host family is really nice. They go out of their way to make me feel at home. The grandmother knows that I miss Chinese food a lot. So she actually learned how to make Chinese food! She also has a teenage granddaughter about my age. Shes really kind and she always talks to me in French to help me practice. You wouldn't believe how quickly my French has improved because of that. Im very comfortable speaking French now. Although I still make lots of mistakes, it doesnt worry me like it used to.  My biggest challenge is learning how to behave at the dinner table. As you can imagine, things are very different from the way they are at home. For example, youre not supposed to put your bread on your plate. Youre supposed to put  it on the table! I thought that was pretty strange at first, but now Im used to  it. Another example is that youre not supposed to eat anything with your hands except bread, not even fruit. You have to cut it up and eat it with a fork. Another thing is its impolite to say that you're full. If you dont want any more food, you should just say, That was delicious. Also, you're not supposed to put your elbows on the table. I have to say that I find it difficult to remember everything, but Im gradually getting used to it. I dont find French  customs so strange anymore. J Vv w , 8 I'll write again soon and tell you more about _ & | my life in France.

April Fools Day is a celebration that takes place in different countries around the world. It happens on April Ist every year and is a day when many people play all kinds of tricks and jokes on each other.  One April Fools Day, a reporter in England announced that there would be no more spaghetti because the spaghetti farmers in Italy had stopped growing spaghetti. Many people ran to their local supermarkets to buy as much spaghetti as they could. By the time people realized that the story was a hoax, all of the spaghetti across the country had been sold out. Another famous trick in England was when a TV show reported the discovery of special water. They said this water would help people lose weight and that one customer had already lost a lot of weight in just four months. By the end of the day, more than 10,000 people had phoned the TV station to find out how to get this water.  Many April Fools jokes may end up being not very funny. A famous TV star once invited his girlfriend onto his show on April Fools Day. He asked her to marry him. The lady was so happy because she really wanted to get married. However, when she said yes, he replied, April Fool! That little joke didnt have a very happy ending. The TV star lost both his girlfriend and his show.  One of the worlds most famous tricks, however, happened in October rather than April. In that month in 1938, actor Orson Welles announced on his radio program that aliens from Mars had landed on the earth. He described where they had landed and told how they were moving across the United States. Welles made it sound so real that hundreds of people believed the story, and fear spread across the whole country. By the time police officers announced that the story was a hoax, thousands  of people had left their homes.  . |Life is full of the unexpected.cseeccesccecccccccccccooee UNIT 12 eeeeeseeeeeeeeei  2c Read the passage again and answer the questions.  1.
