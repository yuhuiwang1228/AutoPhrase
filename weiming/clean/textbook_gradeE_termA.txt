This years Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Tu Youyou (co-winner), whose research led to the discovery of artemisinin, a crucial new treatment for malaria. Artemisinin has saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and has led to improved health for millions of people. Over 200 million people around the world get malaria each year, and about 600,000 die from it. Artemisinin has become a vital part of the treatment for malaria, and is thought to save 100,000 lives  Tu Youyou, a committed and patient scientist, was born in Ningbo, China, on 30 December 1930, and graduated from Peking University Medical School in 1955. After she graduated, she worked at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing. In 1967, the Chinese government formed a team of scientists with the objective of discovering a new treatment for malaria, and Tu Youyou was among the first researchers chosen. In the beginning, Tu Youyou went to Hainan, where malaria was more common, to study malaria patients. In 1969, she became the head of the project in Beijing, and decided to review ancient Chinese medical texts to find traditional botanical treatments for the disease. Her team examined over 2,000 old medical texts, and evaluated  280,000 plants for their medical properties. From their research, they discovered and tested 380 distinct ancient Chinese medical treatments that showed  promise in the fight against malaria.  One medical text from the fourth century suggested using the extract from sweet wormwood to treat a fever. Tu's team tested a collection of dried wormwood leaves but found no effect. They then tried boiling fresh wormwood, and using the liquid obtained from this to treat malaria, but this did not work either. Their project got stuck. However, Tu Youyou would not acknowledge defeat. She analysed the medical texts again, and by chance, she found one sentence suggesting a different way to treat the wormwood. She concluded that boiling the sweet wormwood apparently destroyed its medical properties.  UNIT 1 PEOPLE OF ACHIEVEMENT  Using a lower temperature to draw out the extract, she found a substance that worked. After failing more than 190 times, the team finally succeeded in 1971. Tu Youyou and her team members even insisted on testing the medicine on themselves to make sure that it was safe. Later, the medicine was tested on malaria patients, most of whom recovered. This medicine, which was called artemisinin, soon became a standard treatment for malaria.  According to Tu Youyou, the discovery of artemisinin was a team effort. Upon hearing that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize, she said, The honour is not just mine. There is a team behind me, and all the people of my country. This success proves the great value of traditional Chinese medicine. It is indeed an honour for Chinas scientific research and Chinese medicine to be spread around the world.  3 Circle the answers to the questions below.  1 Where would you most likely find this passage?

Read the text and complete the timeline. Then introduce Einsteins life story and achievements in your own words.  THE MAN WHO CHANGED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE  Albert Einstein, who is perhaps the greatest scientist in modern physics,  is often considered one of the smartest men who ever lived. He made  numerous contributions to the world, the most well-known being  the general theory of relativity and the famous formula E=mc. Einstein was not only a genius; he was a courageous and kind figure loved by many people.  This gentle genius was born in Germany on 14 March 1879.  When he was 16, he tried to enter university in Switzerland, but  failed due to his low scores in the general part of the entrance  exam, despite obtaining exceptional scores in maths and physics. After studying for another year, he managed to pass the exam, entering university in 1896 and graduating in 1900.  After two years of looking for work as a teacher, Einstein took a job as a clerk in the Swiss patent office. While working there, out of a strong  passion for knowledge, he continued to study, earning a doctorate in physics in 1905. That same year, which was later recorded as a miracle year in science, he published four extraordinary physics papers. Following this, he gradually became famous throughout the world as the new Isaac Newton. After four years, he was able to quit his job at the patent office and enter research full-time at a university. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.  Circumstances changed in 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, who was Jewish, found the doors of academic institutions closed to him. As a consequence, he had to flee Germany. After spending time in Europe, he finally took up a position as a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, USA. Following that, he continued to make great achievements in physics and mathematics.  To the public, he was seen as a slightly odd-looking but kind and funny man. He had a thick moustache and long white hair, which sometimes stood on end as though he had just received an electric shock. Although he was a genius, he sometimes forgot things, like his friends birthdays. But despite his peculiarities, he was loved by his friends and neighbours. There is even a story about how he helped a little girl who knocked on his door and asked for help with her homework. In fact, Einstein often encountered people on the street who would stop him and ask him to help explain things. After many such  occasions, he finally started saying, Pardon me! Sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein!  On 18 April 1955, it was reported that Einstein had passed away, and the whole world mourned the great loss of a brilliant scientist.  Born in Germany |  2 Inpairs, discuss the following questions.  1  Apart from his remarkable achievements, what does the passage tell us about Einsteins life?  2 What impressed you most about Einstein?

Read the passage, and then fill in the blanks with relative pronouns or adverbs.  Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925) was widely considered to be the founder and forerunner of modern China. He was only in power for a short time, when he was president of the country in 1912. So it may seem odd to some people knowledge of China may be limited that he is such an important figure. However, his influence is not based on his time in office, but on his continuous struggle for a better society and his concern for all Chinese people. He also put forward many advanced ideas brought the Chinese people together, in particular, the Three Principles of the People. These principles were inspired by Lincoln, he admired, and were developed when he was travelling overseas, he went to find support for his country. The first principle is about nationalism, indicates that China should never be divided and should not be under any foreign control. The second is about people's rights. It means that all people have great value and should also have the same rights. The third is about peoples livelihood,  means that the government should create opportunities for people to make a good living.

SMART HOMES TO MAKE LIFE EASIER  Have you ever forgotten to lock the door of your house? Or, have you ever forgotten to switch off the TV or computer? These kinds of things happen to us all the time, waste resources, and can sometimes lead to problems. However, in the not- too-distant future, we will be living in smart homes that will lock the door for us when we are away and remember to switch off the TV when we forget. These smart homes will keep us secure, save us energy, and provide a more comfortable environment to live in.  Intelligent Controls  Today, we have to use switches for our lights, knobs for our appliances, and remote controls for our TVs and air conditioners. In the future, we will be using advanced technology every day for automatic control of just about everything in our home. The future home will use integrated sensors to tell when  you leave home each morning, and then go into an energy-efficient mode all by itself. You will no longer have to think about turning switches on and off yourself. Your home will also learn your daily routine and preferences, so everything will be ready for you when you get home each evening. Your lights will come on the instant you enter the door along with your favourite music or TV programmes, and  | you will find your dinner already prepared  for you. All controls will respond to voice commands, so if you want to change your routine, you just say aloud what you want and the home system will obey.  Regular Health Checks  In addition, your smart home will be monitoring your health for you every day. Your bed, for example, will record how well you sleep every night. It will also be checking your body weight. If you start to have sleep or weight problems, it will  send a warning to your phone.

SHOULD WE FIGHT NEW TECHNOLOGY?  This morning, I saw the shocking headline: Passenger Dies When Car Crashes in Driverless Mode. In the article, various people said that the public should oppose the idea of developing driverless cars. They said that some advances in technology were unnecessary and could even be dangerous. Hence, we should cease accepting technology just because it is new. The newspaper reported that the car company had already apologised for the accident, but the families of the deceased said it was not enough. Nevertheless, the company still claimed that most people would be travelling in driverless cars one day soon.  On the one hand, there are many different groups of people around the world who live happily in the absence of new technology. Probably the most well known are the Amish, a group of Christians living in rural America. They do not own or drive cars, watch TV, or use the Internet. They have lived mainly as farmers since the 18th century, and they will probably be living the same way in the distant future. They advocate a simple life with an emphasis on hard work, family, and community. They think that is better than caring about luxuries or following the lives of the rich and famous. It could even be argued that the Amishs quality  of life is better since they live in and appreciate the natural environment rather than living in large, polluted cities.  On the other hand, new technology has provided people everywhere with many benefits over the years. For example, the latest weather-tracking computer programmes give people lots of warnings about potential natural disasters, which saves many lives. Moreover, the Internet has made it possible for friends and family to keep in touch easily even if they are on opposite sides of the world. It has also made finding opportunities in life much easier, as it allows people to make larger networks of friends through using social media.  Personally, I have benefited quite a lot from technological advances. I found my career as an AI designer through a social media network. My health monitor, which I wear all the time, has also helped me get into the best shape of my life. Of course, when new technology changes the way we live, it can be a scary prospect. Nevertheless, I will always look on the positive side of change and accept it rather than resist it.  20  1 Aperson died in an accident while driving a car.

Im in the remote far north of Sweden in Sarek National Park, a place with no roads or towns.  2 Sareks mountains used to be covered by vast sheets of ice. Around 9,000 years ago, this ice melted, leaving behind about 100 glaciers. Soon after, reindeer began to arrive. Following the reindeer were the Sami people, who made this territory their home. Getting here is quite difficult, so apart from the Sami very few people have ever seen Sarek. In 1909, Sarek was made a national park in order to keep the land in its natural state. Though the Sami are allowed to continue their traditional way of life in the park, no one else can live here, and all new development is banned within park boundaries. At the far side of the valley, an ancient Sami cottage is visible. Close by, there are a few reindeer feeding on grass.  3 For hundreds of years, looking after reindeer was a way of life for the Sami. They used the reindeers meat for food, their bones for tools, and their skin for making clothes and tents. Since reindeer were always on the move, the Sami would pick up their tents and accompany them. Today, most Sami have houses in villages near Sarek and live a modern life just like their neighbours. But every spring, a small number of Sami still follow their reindeer into the valleys of Sarek, living  26 UNIT 3 FASCINATING PARKS in tents or old cottages and enjoying their traditions. | am not a Sami, but in Sarek Ive adopted some of their habits.

This new park is nearly four times larger than the old wildlife park protecting Siberian tigers in Northeast China. Over the years, increased development in the area affected the tigers habitat, and it was thought that by 1998 there were only six to nine wild Siberian tigers living in the region. However, a on development put in place in 2015 resulted in a population increase of the species, and now the area is thought to have about 35 tigers and 70 leopards. The problem, however, was that the old park was too small to support further population increases. Always , Siberian tigers and leopards need large areas to hunt for food.

LISTENING TO HOW BODIES TALK  We use both words and body language to express our thoughts and opinions in our interactions with other people. We can learn a lot about what people are thinking by watching their body language. Words are important, but the way people stand, hold their arms, and move their hands can also give us information about their feelings.  Just like spoken language, body language varies from culture to culture. The crucial thing is using body language in a way that is appropriate to the culture you are in. For example, making eye contactlooking into someone's eyes  in some countries is a way to display interest. In other countries, by contrast, eye contact is not always approved of. For example, in many Middle Eastern countries, men and women are not socially permitted to make eye contact. In Japan, it may demonstrate respect to look down when talking to an older person.  The gesture for OK" has different meanings in different cultures. In Japan, someone who witnesses another person employing the gesture might think it means money. In France, a person encountering an identical gesture may interpret it as meaning zero. However, you should avoid making this gesture in Brazil and Germany, as it is not considered polite.  Even the gestures we use for yes and no differ around the world. In many countries, shaking ones head means no, and nodding means yes". By comparison, in Bulgaria and southern Albania, the gestures have the opposite meaning. There are also differences in how we touch each other, how close we stand to someone Y  we are talking to, and how we act when we meet or part.

Placing your hands together and resting them on the side of your head while closing your eyes means sleep. A good way of saying ! am full is moving your hand in circles over your stomach after a meal.  Some body language has many different uses. Perhaps the best example is smiling. A smile can help us get through difficult situations and find friends in a world of strangers. A smile can break down barriers. We can use a smile to apologise, to greet someone, to ask for help, or to start a conversation. Experts suggest smiling at yourself in the mirror to make yourself feel happier and stronger. And if we are feeling down or lonely, there is nothing better than seeing the smiling face of a good friend.

We make assessments and inferences from body language. And according to those judgements we one person and dislike another. So body language provides external that are influenced by internal thoughts and feelings. Scientists have found that when we feel proud and powerful, we usually straighten up to make ourselves bigger. , when we feel powerless, we tend to slump, making ourselves smaller. It is obvious that our minds can influence our bodies. But is it also true that our bodies can affect our minds? Scientific experiments show that if we make powerful long enough, we may actually feel more powerful. People who remember to use positive body language are more likely to feel positive , SO some scientists suggest that we use our bodies to try power posing to help our feelings of shyness and powerlessness.  40 UNIT 4 BODY LANGUAGE | Discover useful structures  | 1 Look at the examples below, paying attention to the italicised parts.

As an educator, people often ask me how I know what is going on in the minds of my students. Many students are quite shy and dont speak all that much. At the same time, in a classroom of more than forty students, it is hard to have many one-on-one conversations with each person. So, how can I really know what makes each student tick?  My answer? I look at their body language.  It is easy to recognise when students are interested in a lesson. Most tend to look up and make eye contact. When I make a joke, they smile. When I talk about something difficult, they look confused. I know when students are really interested, however, because they lean forward and look at me. People have a tendency to lean towards whatever they are interested in. So if a student has his head lowered to look at his watch, it implies he is bored and just counting the minutes for the class to end. If two friends are leaning their heads together, they are probably writing notes to each other. Of course, not everyone who looks up is paying attention in class. Some students look up, but there is an absence of eye contact. Their eyes barely move, and they always have the same distant expression on their faces. It is as though they are asleep with their eyes open.  Some students are amused by something else. They spend all their time looking anywhere but at me. Then again, some students favourite activity is daydreaming. With their chins on their hands, they occupy themselves by staring out of the window or up at the ceiling. They are certainly interested in something, but who knows what. The main thing is reminding distracted students that they need to pay attention in class.  While it is easy to perceive when students are interested, bored, or distracted, it is sometimes much harder to distinguish when students are troubled. Students who are angry, afraid, or experiencing anxiety may have their arms crossed in front of their chests and their legs closed or crossed, like they are guarding their bodies. Students who are sad or worried will nearly always wear a frown. They may also hide their faces in their hands like they are embarrassed or ashamed. Some students act this way merely because they are afraid of being called on by the teacher. However, if a student does not bother to brush her hair and her eyes are red from weeping, then I can infer that there are deeper issues at work. It could be that she is having serious conflicts with other students or at home. Whatever it is, I know I need to inquire and assess what is going on.  Ultimately, my duty is helping every student to learn. Their body language lets me know when to adjust class activities, when to intervene, and when to talk to students individually, so they can all get the most out of school. Reacting to body language is an important component of being a teacher.  UNIT 4 BODY LANGUAGE 2 Match the body language with the meanings.

Paragraph 5 E Yuan's innovation has helped to feed more people. Paragraph 6 F Yuan cares little for fame or wealth.  A PIONEER FOR ALL PEOPLE  Yuan Longping, known as the father of hybrid rice, is one of China's most famous scientists. Yet, he considers himself a farmer because he continually works the land in his research. Indeed, his slim but strong body is just like that of millions of Chinese farmers, to whom he has devoted his life.  Yuan Longping was born in 1930 in Beijing. His parents wanted him to pursue a career in science or medicine. However, what concerned him most was that farmers often had poor harvests and sometimes even had a serious shortage of food to eat. To tackle this crisis, he chose to study agriculture and received an education at Southwest Agricultural College in Chongqing.  After graduating in 1953, he worked as a researcher. Yuan  Longping realised that larger fields were not the solution.  Instead, farmers needed to boost yields in the fields they  had. How this could be done was a challenging question  at the time. Yuan was convinced that the answer could  be found in the creation of hybrid rice. A hybrid is a cross between two or more varieties of a species. One characteristic of hybrids is that they usually attain a higher yield than conventional crops. However, whether it was possible to develop a hybrid of self-pollinating plants such as rice was a matter of great debate. The common assumption then was that it could not be done. Through intense effort, Yuan overcame enormous technical difficulties to develop the first hybrid rice that could be used for farming in 1974. This hybrid enabled farmers to expand their output greatly.  Today, it is estimated that about 60 percent of domestic rice consumption in China is  50 UNIT 5 WORKING THE LAND  comprised of crops generated from Yuan's hybrid strains, and his strains have allowed China's farmers to produce around 200 million tons of rice per year. Yuan's innovation has helped feed not just China, but many other countries that depend on rice as well, such as India and Vietnam. Because of his invaluable contributions, Yuan Longping has received numerous awards both in China and abroad.  Given that Yuan's hybrids have made him quite wealthy, one might think he would retire to a life of leisure. However, this is far from the case. Deep down, Yuan is still very much a farmer at heart. As a man of the soil, he cares little for celebrity or money. Instead, he makes large donations to support agricultural research.  What impresses people most about Yuan Longping is his ongoing ability to fulfil his dreams. Long ago, he envisioned rice plants as tall as sorghum, with each ear of rice as big as a broom, and each grain of rice as huge as a peanut. He succeeded in producing a kind of rice that could feed more people at home and abroad. His latest vision for seawater rice has also become a reality, and potentially opened up nearly one million square kilometres of salty land in China for rice production. Despite his advanced years, Yuan Longping is still young at heart and full of vision, and everyone is waiting to see what he | will dream up next.  3 Read the text again and answer the questions.

But that never became and the shelter was left for 70 years. Then businessmen decided to make use of it to grow green vegetables to meet increasing demands.  The tunnels are lit with pink LEDs as there is no natural light below the ground. The vegetables are grown in special liquids instead of the earth that is used as in farming.

CHEMICAL VERSUS ORGANIC FARMING  Chemical pesticides and artificial fertilisers have been in widespread use in farming since the middle of the 20th century. When they were first introduced, many farmers welcomed them as a great way to fight crop disease and increase production. Over time, however, what some scientists have found is that their long-term use can sometimes harm both the land and peoples health.  For example, pesticides can damage the land by killing not only harmful bacteria and insects, but also helpful ones. In addition, these chemicals can stay in the soil and underground water sources for a long time. This affects the crops grown on the land and, in turn, the animals and humans who digest them. Many people worry that these chemicals may make them ill and even cause cancer. In fact, some pesticides like DDT have been prohibited in most countries because of the damage they cause to people and the environment. As for chemical fertilisers, crops grown with them usually grow too fast to be rich in nutrition. They may look beautiful on the outside, but inside there is usually more water than essential minerals, and they often have less flavour as well.  As an alternative, some farmers have switched to organic farming, and many customers have turned to organic food when they shop at the local grocery. Organic farming is simply farming without using any chemicals. Organic farmers focus on keeping their soil rich and free of disease through natural means. For example, many organic farmers use natural waste from animals as fertiliser. This makes the soil in their fields richer in minerals. It also keeps the air, soil, water, and crops free of chemicals.  Organic farmers also use many other methods to produce rich soil. They often change the kind of  UNIT5 WORKING THELAND = 55  56  Using Language  crop grown in each field every year. For instance, they may grow corn or wheat in a field one year, and then grow beans there the next. Why different crops are grown is because they put important minerals back into the ground, making it ready for the next batch of crops. Organic farmers also plant diverse crops that use different depths of soil to help keep it rich. For example, peanuts grow on the grounds surface, but many other vegetables put down deep roots. The goal of using different organic farming methods is to grow good food while avoiding damage to the environment or to peoples health.  Some people would prefer to stop the use of man-made chemicals in agriculture entirely. What keeps them from doing so is the fact that chemical farming serves the high demand for food around the world. Organic farming is nowhere near able to meet that need. Therefore, there is still a long way to find a suitable solution that puts sufficient food on the dinner table while keeping people and the environment as healthy as possible.  Why did many farmers welcome the introduction of chemical farming?  What concerns many people about the use of pesticides?  What is one problem with the use of chemical fertilisers?

In his travels, he observed that some farmers had much better  than others, so he decided to investigate the best ways of good harvests. After retiring, he wrote a book, Qi Min Yao Shu, which sound advice and practices for people doing agricultural work. In one piece of advice, , he told farmers to clear weeds  from the ground before planting crops. They could either let the animals eat the weeds or turn the over so that the weeds were covered. Then he gave advice on ploughing, suggesting that the autumn ploughing should be at a greater than the spring ploughing. He also suggested changing crops to get better harvests every year. Finally, he suggested that farmers grow a range of crops next to each other in the fields. Although it has been centuries since Jia Sixie died, Qi Min Yao Shu is still considered a(n) book in Chinas agricultural history.  1 Why did Jia Sixie investigate good ways of farming? 2 What makes Qi Min Yao Shu an important book in Chinas agricultural history?  2 Fillin the blanks with that, whether, or wh- question words to complete the  | sentences. | 1 the research centre is to be set up has not been decided. 2 many countries still face food shortages remains a big problem. 3 impressed me most was that the hybrid rice enabled farmers to expand their | output greatly. | 4 the plan is to be carried out still needs discussing. 5 the new chemical pesticide is effective remains to be seen. | 6 will join in the research team will be announced tomorrow. | 7 he quit his high-paying job is not difficult to understand.

How should this knowledge affect your daily life?  Brainstorm a list of your favourite dishes. Each dish should be comprised of five or more ingredients.  Choose one dish from your list that everyone in your group likes. Find a list of its ingredients from a recipe or a product label.  EXAMPLE: Kung Pao Chicken is made with chicken, peanuts, onions, red peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, ginger, garlic, oil, cooking wine, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, etc.  Assign team members to research where and how each of these ingredients is produced.  EXAMPLE: Peanuts are planted in April or May. It takes around 120 to 160 days for them to be ready for harvesting. This is usually done by hand. The farmer pulls the peanut plants out of the ground and leaves them in the field to dry. The peanuts are then collected and separated from their vines. They are dried for some more time and then taken to the market for sale.  5 Work together to make a poster about your favourite dish.

Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.  Now and then | have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see. Recently | asked a friend, who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, what she had observed. Nothing in particular, she replied.  How was it possible, | asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note? | who cannot see find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. | feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. | pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. In spring | touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening Nature after her winters sleep. Occasionally, if | am very fortunate, | place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song.  At times my heart cries out with longing to see all these things. If | can get so much pleasure from mere touch, how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. And | have imagined what | should most like to see if | were given the use of my eyes, say for just three days.  On the first day, | should want to see the people Helen Keller whose kindness and companionship have made , my life worth living. | do not know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through that window of the soul, the eye. | can only see through my fingertios the outline of a face. | can detect laughter, sorrow, and many other obvious emotions. | know my friends from the feel of their faces.  For instance, can you describe accurately the faces of five different friends? As an experiment, | have questioned husbands about the colour of their wives eyes, and often they express embarrassed confusion and admit that they do not know.  | should like to see the books which have been read to me, and which have revealed to me the deepest channels of human life. In the afternoon | should take a long walk in the woods and intoxicate my eyes on the beauties of the world of Nature. And | should pray for the glory of a colourful sunset. That night, | should not be able to sleep.  On my second day, | should like to see the pageant of mans progress, and | should go to the museums. | should try to probe into the soul of man through his art. The things | knew through touch | should now see. The evening of my second day | should spend at a theatre or at the movies.  The following morning, | should again greet the dawn, anxious to discover new delights, new revelations of beauty. Today, this third day, | shall spend in the workaday world, amid the haunts of men going about the business of life.  At midnight permanent night would close on me again. Only when darkness had again descended upon me should | realise how much | had left unseen.  | am sure that if you faced the fate of blindness you would use your eyes as never before. Everything you saw would become dear to you. Your eyes would touch and embrace every object that came within your range of vision. Then, at least, you would really see, and a new world of beauty would open itself before you.  | who am blind can give one hint to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And the same method can be applied to the other senses. Hear the music of voices, the song of a bird, the mighty strains of an orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again.

CLONING: WHERE IS IT LEADING US?  When it was announced in 2018 that the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai had created the world's first cloned monkeys, Zhongzhong and Huahua, heated discussions followed online. In fact, cloning has always been with us. It is a way of making an exact copy of another animal or plant. It happens in plants when gardeners take cuttings from growing plants to make new ones. It also happens in animals when identical twins are produced from the same egg. These are both examples of natural clones.  Cloning has two major uses. First, gardeners use it to produce large quantities of plants for sale. Second, it is valuable for research on new plant species and for medical research on animals. Cloning plants is fairly straightforward, while cloning animals is much more complicated and difficult. Over the years, many scientists failed in their attempts to clone animals, but their determination and patience paid off in 1996 with a breakthroughthe cloning of Dolly the sheep.  The sheep cloning procedure works like this: e Female sheep A provides an egg cell.  The nucleus is removed from the egg  cell.   The egg cell is ready for a new nucleus.  e Female sheep B provides a somatic cell (   ) for the clone. The nucleus of this cell contains all the genes needed to produce a new sheep.   The nucleus is taken out of the somatic cell.   The somatic cell nucleus from sheep B and the egg cell from sheep A are joined.  The cell divides and grows into an embryo.   The embryo is put into female sheep C, who becomes the carrier of the clone.  The lamb which is born is the clone of sheep B. It is in every way identical to sheep B, but younger.  -   - UNIT2 LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE  ~~~ WORKBOOK :       = _  With the advances of scientific research, cloning will have several major uses in the future. For one thing, it could be used to breed animal species which are endangered, or even bring back species which are now extinct. For another, it could be used to grow human organs or tissue in animals, which could be used for human organ transplants or medical treatments. Finally, cloning could be used to breed animals that will provide us with higher quality meat, milk, or eggs.  While there are technical issues that need to be worked through to make widespread cloning possible, the biggest concerns are moral. For example, if scientists brought an extinct animal back into existence, it would probably end up living in a zoo. That is not very good for the animal. Even worse for the animal is using it as a source of organ transplantsbecause it will be injured or even die. In addition, many people worry that eating animal products that result from cloning might be harmful to our health over time. The possibility of using cloning to produce human beings is an even bigger concern. What would happen if such knowledge ended up in the wrong hands?  When it comes to cloning, we wonder, ultimately, whether cloning will help or harm the world. No doubt, we will be talking about this question for a long time to come.  2 Answer the questions using information from the text.  What are the two examples of natural clones?

These futurists tried to predict the future. Only a few of their predictions were right, and all of them missed something that was just around the corner: the revolution in computers and information technology. The problem was that none of these futurists were scientists or engineers. So, while they knew the future would have more powerful computers, they had no clue what these computers would look like, what they could do, or what impact they would have on our lives.  This should make us hesitate before we try to predict the future. Having said that, we can | make some good guesses about future technology by looking at current scientific and technological advances. We can also ask the real experts: the scientists and engineers who are bringing us these advances.  According to experts, in the future computers will be so common that we may no longer even notice them. Forget smartphones and smart watcheswe will have smart clothes that adjust to the weather and our body temperature, and change size to fit our body shape. We will  also have smart contact lenses. Using these smart contact lenses, we can access the information and power of computers in a way that far  | Cs - exceeds anything currently possible.  Because so much of our daily life will be integrated with computers, virtual reality will become an actual, real reality for many of us. Technology will not just allow us to see a world that is thousands of kilometres away  Or which only exists in  73 | WORKBOOK  7  a computerbut will also allow us to touch and smell that world. This virtual world will at times seem as real asif not more real thanthe actual world around us. Without leaving  home, you will be able to take tours of foreign countries, or even get a medical exam by a doctor in another city.  Speaking of medicine, through new technology, people who have brain or spinal injuries will be able to find new hope. There is already, for example, technology which will allow blind people to see using cameras and deaf people to hear using microphones that are connected to their brains. Future technology will allow people to overcome all sorts of physical disabilities.  Much research is being done to unlock the human mind. Using technology that is being | developed now, people in the future may be able to not just read someone elses mind, but | also record their thoughts like one would record a movie. Some other research involves using robotic technology to replace human functions. For example, robot hands are being developed | for people who have no hands. These artificial hands are connected to a persons nerves so that the persons brain tells the hands what to do. In the future they will work just as well as real | human hands. Indeed, they may even be better. Not only can they be made stronger and faster | than human hands, but also sturdier so they will not break or get injured as easily.  As a result of such advances, in the future, some people who are badly injured may become more robot than human. That is, their brains will control their robotic body parts so they can live their lives fully without being handicapped. Many new parts will be made to replace human body parts that break down, meaning it may be possible to use this technology to extend our | lives long past the time of normal death by old age.  These are just a few of the things that are already being explored in science and technology. | There will also be advances in transportation and space travel. Of course, there is a lot that  we still do not know about the future. Science and technology may provide a road map for the future, but they cannot tell us what we will find along the way. But if we knew everything about the future, then where would the mystery and excitement be? We should all eagerly view the future as a great adventurea new world waiting to be explored.

Well, now | can safely say that Ive been there!  Before you get too excited, | must admit that this Shangri-La is the name of a city in | Yunnan, China, and not the place in the book! | decided to come here because | wanted to experience the real Shangri-La for myself, even if it's different from the paradise we read about. So far, | really like it here.  On Monday, | left Lhasa at noon, and after changing flights once, | reached Shangri-La also called "Zhongdian " at eight in the evening. The airport is not far from the city, so my taxi ride to the hotel was very short. That night, | was so exhausted that | had a quick bite to eat and then crashed.  Yesterday, | went to the Potatso National Park. The park covers such a wide area that the admission ticket for the park includes a bus tour, as it is the only way to see all the major sites in one day.

Some of the best family holidays involve things like picnics, camping, hikes, and forest walks. Exploring nature allows us to catch sight of rare animals and come across special places of beauty. Of course, none of this would be possible without protected nature areas. This is why national parks are so important. They are places to be treasuredplaces where the country locks away the very best it has to offer for everyone to enjoy. To protect this heritage, governments allow very little development inside most national parks. A few national parks allow things like hotels and recreation areas to be | constructed within them, but most parks do not allow any development at all. Visitors have to bring in their own food and drink, and then be sure to carry out all their waste when they leave.  The very first national park is also one of the most famous in the worldYellowstone, in the  western USA. Nineteenth-century explorers were amazed by what they saw in Yellowstone.  Apart from the beautiful mountains, rushing rivers, and tall waterfalls, there were geysers,  which sent boiling water as high as 91 metres into the air. Then there were the hot springs, as | colourful as rainbows. These explorers wanted to protect the natural features of the area from development so that future generations could enjoy the area. And so, in 1872, Yellowstone | was established as a national park. Today, around four million people a year visit it. Many come hoping to see wildlife, which is no longer as common in the American West as it once | was. Everyone comes to see the geysers, especially Old Faithful, which sits near the centre of | the park, and sends 95.6C water up to 56 metres into the air every 44 to 125 minutes.  While Yellowstone was made a national park in order to protect its natural features, many others were set up to protect wildlife. A good example is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. In the local African language, Serengeti means the place where the land runs on forever. It is a wide plain covered in tall grass, and dotted with trees. When foreigners began killing the Serengeti lions for sport, the government decided to take action, eventually turning the area into a national park in 1951. Even then, it was a challenge to protect the park's wildlife. In 1959, a film was made of the great wildebeest migration which occurs every  Se Ee UNIT3 FASCINATING PARKS  year in the park. This film, Serengeti Shall Not Die, helped people around the world understand the need for wildlife protection. Today, the Serengeti is one of the top tourist attractions in the world. Nowhere else can you see such great herds of wildebeests and zebras, in addition to lions, rhinoceroses, elephants, and many other rare creatures.  og ae a Not all famous national parks are on land. Some national ot oe parks are marine parks. One good example of this is the _ Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia. Stretching over 2,300 kilometres, the Great Barrier Reef is considered one of the natural wonders of the world. It is the largest structure in the world made by living creatures. A wide variety of tropical wildlife also makes the reef its home. Since the Great Barrier Reef is just below the surface of the water, it is an excellent place to see nature, and millions of people travel there every year. The park was created in 1975 to protect the reef from overdevelopment and fishing. Unfortunately, the biggest danger to the Great Barrier | * Reef is something park management cannot stopglobal warming. Rising ocean temperatures are causing some coral to die and the colourful reefs to turn grey. Hundreds of years ago, people could not imagine that there would ever be a time when forests would be cut down, oceans would become polluted, and wildlife would face extinction.  Facing the problems of environment pollution and overdevelopment, some national parks have been set aside to protect both natural features and wildlife. A good example of this is the Sanjiangyuan National Park, which was set up in the south of Chinas Qinghai Province in 2000. The park is at a very high altitude and contains the source of the Yangtze River (Changjiang), Lancang River, and Yellow River. It is also home to many species of plants and birds, along with animals like Tibetan antelopes, snow leopards, wolves, foxes, bears, yaks, and sheep. In most areas of the reserve, development is strictly forbidden, and any permitted development is closely monitored.  The protection of natural areas has attracted much media attention, and now more and more people are supporting the idea of eco-friendly development. Today, people understand that national parks are not just for one generation; they should be protected for every generation to come.  81 a  UNIT 4  82  5 People  Using Words and Expressions  1 Complete the sentences with the  correct forms of the words in the box.  reliable difference low assessment inquiry adjust compare angry  1 The teacher should make some so that the students will not get bored.  2 The twin brothers are alike in appearance but greatly in personality.  3 Seeing the boy so upset, the mother called the teacher to on at school.  what was going  4 In with big cities, these places are less modern but more natural.  heavily on the Internet to keep in touch with one another.  6 The test was to the level of students self-respect rather than their academic achievement.  7 The young man managed to hold back his and avoid a serious conflict.  8 In class, students tend to their  heads when the question is too hard for them.

ANIMAL BODY LANGUAGE  Human beings are not the only ones who communicate. Animals use body language to tell each other how they feel and what they think. Here is a quick look at how some of our animal friends send messages to us and to each other.  Dogs use sounds, body movements, and their tails to communicate. When a dog is happy, its ears will stand up and its eyes will be wide open. The dog will start barking, moving its tail, and running around in circles or jumping up and down to show you that it wants to play. A dog that is afraid will lay on its back and close its eyes. The dog may show its teeth and lower its body so that it is close to the ground. The dog may also shake, and it will put its tail between its legs. When a dog is angry, its main body language is showing its teeth and growling. The dog will try making itself look as big as possible. The tail will stand straight out from the body.  Elephants also use noises and body language to express themselves. An elephants sense of smell is highly developed. An elephant can smell how another elephant is feeling and even tell if it is sick. The elephants nose, or trunk, is also used to make noises and to welcome other elephants. Different noises have a variety of meanings: they can mean | am hungry, I am angry, or Good to see you! An elephants body language includes ear signals and gestures. If an elephant spreads its ears, it means Watch out! To show friendship, elephants will touch each other with their trunks and stand close to each other, putting their heads together.  Dolphins are social animals. They live in groups and love showing each other their feelings. An angry dolphin will sometimes hit its tail on the surface of the water. The movement and noise let other dolphins know that something is wrong. If a dolphin wants to send a message over a long distance, or if it wants to show how strong it is, it will jump high out of the water and land on its side, making a loud noise. A dolphins favourite activity is leaping into the air while playing with its friends. When dolphins are tired and need to rest, they will swim in small groups close to the surface. If you see dolphins doing this, you should not disturb them.  85   WORKBOOK     -  1 happiness * shows teeth and growls a elephant * ears stand up and eyes wide open  2 fear  shows teeth and lowers body aa  3 anger * spreads ears 3 9   puts its head against another's 4 warnin ial * hits its tail down to make noise yo dolphin 5 affection  leaps into the air  2  Whatis the cats body language communicating in each picture?

Up to now, nobody has been able to create laughter like Charlie Chaplin. He brightened the lives of millions through two world wars and the hard years in between. He made people laugh at a time when they felt depressed, so they could forget their difficulties.  Not that Charlies own life was easy. He was born to a poor family in 1889. His parents were both poor music hall performers. To make money, Charlie learnt to sing as soon as he could speak, and dance as soon as he could walk. Such training was common in stage families at that time. Every member of the family performed to help make money. Then his father died, and so Charlie spent his youth looking after his sick mother and his brother. By his teens, Charlie had, through his humour, become one of the most popular child actors in England. No one was bored watching himhe made  everything funny.  As time went by, Chaplin began making silent films, where the  story was told only through body language and gestures. Usually, Chaplin appeared in these films as the Little Tramp, a poor man with a moustache, large trousers, worn-out shoes, and a small, round hat. He walked around stiffly, carrying a walking stick. Even though the Little Tramp was considered a failure in life, he was still full of kindness and hope. Like Chaplin, the Little Tramp always tried to turn his sadness into joy. Chaplin once said, My pain may be the reason for somebody's laugh. But my laugh must never be the reason for somebody's pain. He also said, To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it!  87 WORKBOOK   88  In 1914 and 1915Chaplin worked almost constantly, making nearly 50 short films. These films were so popular around the world that by 1916, Chaplin had a salary of $670,000 a year ($15 million in todays money). Though short films were in high demand, Chaplins popularity allowed him to take more time and make longer films. One of these films, The Kid (1921), is considered to be among the greatest films ever made. In the film, the Little Tramp finds a baby that has been abandoned, and raises the child as his own. While the film has many funny moments, it also has times of great sadness. As Chaplin said, it was a picture with a smile, and perhaps a tear.  How did the Little Tramp make a sad situation funny? Here is an example from one of his most famous films, The Gold Rush (1925). It is around 1900, and gold has just been discovered in Alaska. The Little Tramp has rushed there in search of gold, but without success. Instead, he is hiding in a small house on a mountain during a snowstorm, with nothing to eat. He is so hungry that he has cooked a pair of leather shoes for dinner. Chaplin first cuts off the laces and eats them as if they were noodles. Then he cuts off the leather top of the shoe and eats it as if it were the finest beef. Finally, he tries cutting up and eating the bottom of the shoe, making you believe that this is one of the best meals he has ever tasted.  When the silent era ended in 1929, Chaplin continued to make films, but these films had little or no dialogue. They had just music and sound effects. Unfortunately, his style of visual humour had gone out of style and so his films were not as successful as before. Finally, in 1940, Chaplin gave up silent films to make The Great Dictator. This became Chaplins most successful movie. It was also his last great success. Essentially, Chaplin went into retirement afterwards, though he made a handful of films later on.  Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, and produced the films he starred in.

BETTER, GREENER LIVES AWAY FROM THE CITY  While the dream of most university graduates is to start a successful career in a big city, more and more young people are choosing to stay in their own hometowns so they can stay with their family and friends. For some young people, it is also a matter of making the quality of life for other people in their hometowns better. They also have a desire to improve and maintain the natural and economic environments in these places for generations to come.  Li Dan is a woman who has discovered that returning home to work in the field of agriculture could offer her both a meaningful challenge and a good standard of living. Born in a small village in Southwest China, she decided not to follow many of her former classmates to the city after getting her degree at university. Instead, she returned to her village and started her own fruit-growing business. Working hard over the last several years, and taking advantage of new technology and the Internet, she has expanded her business to include agritourism. Moreover, her companys annual income has reached six million yuan and more than 50 new jobs have been created. As a result, her decision has also helped to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of many people in her village.  With Chinas population expected to continue rising in the coming years, the government understands the importance of agriculture. It also understands that university graduates can help come up with better ways to grow crops, and develop new, creative ways of farming using modern technology. To help these young people with their bright and innovative ideas, the government is providing financial help. Business development loans are becoming easier for these young people to obtain, too. Government policies that aim to eliminate poverty are also having a beneficial effect.  Life in big cities is not all it's cracked up to be, said Zhang Tao, from Binchuan county in Yunnan Province, adding that the air was bad, transport was terrible, and it was hard to make a decent living. What life in ones hometown offers is a strong support network. More importantly, this network is also a good one for getting new agribusinesses up and running quite quickly. Thus, it is no surprise that more new graduates are now attracted to life in the country, where they can fulfil personal goals and contribute to their local communities rather than just being white-collar professionals in big cities.  92  - UNIT5 WORKING THE LAND  What do some young people hope to achieve by living in their hometowns? How has Li Dans decision to work in her hometown contributed to her community? Why does the government support people who want to stay and work in their hometowns?

Long ago, farmers would work hard on their individual plots of land, using simple tools or even their bare hands. They tended to their crops for many hours each day so that the crops grew well and did not suffer from pests or disease. Luck played a great part in farming. For example, a single storm could destroy a whole years work, while a summer of good weather could ensure a good harvest. Where farms were located was often critical to success, too. In hilly countries, some lucky farmers would have land in the lowlandsfull of deep, rich soil, while other unlucky farmers would have land on the hills with hard soil full of stones. In addition, some areas would simply be too dry or too wet to grow much of value.  Modern science and technology have helped to greatly reduce the back-breaking labour involved in farming, along with the reliance on luck and guesswork. These advances  have enabled people in various countries to benefit from exceptional innovations in crop production.  Probably one of the most beneficial innovations is drip irrigation, which has made it possible to develop big, green farms in the _ middle of the desert. While there have been experiments in = different places in the past to make drip irrigation a reality, it is in the Middle Eastern country of Israel that drip irrigation has become a modern success.  How Simcha Blass, a scientist, discovered this new way of irrigation is rather interesting. He was visiting a friend in the Israeli desert in the 1930s when he noticed something unusual. There was a row of trees near his friends house, and one of them was much taller than the others. When Blass dug around the roots to find out what the secret was, he discovered that the house's water pipe had a small leak at the base of the tree. The pipes steady drip onto the tree's roots was giving it just enough water at the perfect rate to grow strong and quickly. oo  Through this discovery, farmers can now produce crops on arid land without needing much water. This irrigation method uses far less water than other methods. The limited and focused use of just the right amount of water also denies moisture to weeds and pests, keeping them from harming the crops.  Drip irrigation deals with a lack of water in an area. However, what if an area has plenty of water, but little usable soil? As it turns out, it is possible to grow plants without using soil at all. With hydroponics, plant roots are supported by rocks, glass beads, or a fibre mat. Nutrient-rich water is then provided so that the plants can grow. Given that China has many areas where soil conditions are poor, Chinese researchers have been experimenting with hydroponics since the 1970s. Recent research has centred on vertical hydroponics farming. With a vertical farm, the crops are planted in trays that are stacked into plant skyscrapers. Furthermore, nearly all hydroponic farms and vertical farms are either partially or fully automated.  Besides drip irrigation and hydroponics, scientists have made impressive innovations in agricultural machinery. Of course, the most important and useful agricultural machines, such as tractors and harvesters, were invented long ago. However, many such machines are now self-driving. They use cameras and a positioning system to see where they are and where they are going, and their routes can be planned by a computer. Depending upon the crop, some farms hundreds or thousands of hectares in size can be managed by just a handful of workers | using machines such as these. For fruit cultivation, - robots are now being employed in some countries. For  instance, in Japan, robots are used to spray individual grape clusters with insecticide, trim them so they are  all of equal size, bag them so that they can be further  protected from pests and the elements, and then harvest them when they are ripe. In other countries, robots are being used to harvest oranges and strawberries, plant rice, and spray pesticides. The field of agricultural robotics is still in its infancy, so there is still a need for human labour to harvest many crops. To help ease this burden, there are also robots that can help workers carry fruit and vegetables to storage areas.  With such technological advances, the image of a farmer pushing a plough will eventually become a thing of the past. Farmers, of the future are more likely to be technicians working in control rooms, sure nded ye computers and monitors, Indeed,  some farmers aieady are.
