What do you think a domestic robot could do for a family in the future?  Read the story below, which was originally written by famous science  fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Take notes on who these people are and their  relationships to each other.   Larry Belmont  Claire  Tony  Gladys Claffern  SATISFACTION GUARANTEED (Adapted)  Larry Belmont worked for a company m that made robots. Recently it had begun experimenting with a  household robot. It was going  to be tested out by Larry's wife, Claire.  Claire didn't want the robot in her house, especially as her husband would be away on a business trip for three weeks,  but Larry persuaded her that the robot wouldn't harm her or allow her to be harmed. It would be a bonus. However, when she first saw the robot, she felt alarmed. His name was Tony. He seemed more like a human than a machine. He was tall and handsome with smooth hair and a deep voice, although his facial expression never changed.  On the second morning, Tony brought her breakfast and then asked her whether she needed help dressing. She felt embarrassed and quickly told him to go. Now she was being looked after by a robot that looked so human, and it was disturbing.  One day, Claire mentioned that she didn't think she was clever. Tony said that she must feel very unhappy to say that. Claire thought it was ridiculous that she was being offered sympathy by a robot, but she gradually admired his wisdom and integrity and began to trust him. He always treated her with dignity. She told him how she was  UNIT 1 SCIENCE FICTION  Compare and contrast  Some words and phrases are often used  to compare and contrast information.

She wasn't like Gladys Claffern, one of the richest and most powerful women around.  As a favour, Tony promised to help Claire make herself more beautiful and her home more elegant. So Claire borrowed some library books for him to read, or rather, scan. She looked at his fingers with wonder as they turned each page. How absurd, she thought. He was just a machine.  Tony gave Claire a new hairstyle and improved her makeup. As he was not allowed to accompany her to the shops, he wrote out a list of things that he would need for his work on the house. Claire went downtown and bought these things. She had an appointment to paint her nails, then she went into an expensive clothes shop. The saleswoman there was rude to her, so she rang Tony and told him she was being treated badly. He spoke to the woman, who immediately changed her attitude. Claire thanked Tony, telling him that he was a "dear". As she turned around, there stood Gladys Claffern. How awful to be discovered by her, Claire thought. By the look on her face, Claire knew that Gladys thought they were in a relationship. After all, she knew Claire's husband's name was Larry, not Tony. Although it was completely innocent, Claire felt guilty. When Claire got home, she wept. Gladys was everything Claire wished to be. Tony told her she was being sensitive and was just as good as Gladys. He suggested that she invite Gladys and her friends to the house the night before he was to leave and Larry was to return. By that time, Tony expected that the house, which was being completely transformed, would be ready.  Tony worked steadily on the improvements. Claire tried to help by working on a light suspended from the ceiling, but she fell off the ladder. Even though Tony had been in  How do you think this story will end?

The night of the party arrived. The clock struck eight. The guests would be arriving soon, so Claire dismissed Tony for the rest of the night. At that moment, Tony took her in his arms, bringing his face close to hers. She heard him declare that he did not want to leave her the next day, and that he felt more than just the desire to please her. Then the front door bell rang.  Then listen to the rest of the story.

For example, robots first appeared in sci-fi novels, but now robot soldiers have already been in war. Robot experts have also built robots that can see, talk, and do other things like humans. Although a robot that looks a human than a machine could make many people a bit uncomfortable, we have to admit that it is a possibility. Sophia, currently said to be the most advanced Al robot in the world, is a great example. She has been interviewed many times, appeared on the covers of magazines, and become the first non-human in the world to be given citizenship by a country. When it comes to games, 2017 became a year in which Al defeated humans in so many games that Al researchers say that it will not be long before Al can win at almost everything. So have we lost the of being the most intelligent creature? Maybe in the future, as Al becomes even more , it will become a major threat to humans. However, some people this fear. They believe if Al can handle tasks like calculating and driving for us, we will have more time for creating, thinking, and being human.

Since | arrived, my friend has brought me to my first open-air barbecue and has also shared many different but yummy meals with me, so my first impressions of Australia have been all about food! A lot of typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast, is originally British. Bakeries, fast-food joints, butcher shops, cafes, and restaurants everywhere provide some of the premier food experiences in the world. The influence of Asian cultures, on the other hand, led to the introduction of bean curd and Asian herbs, along with Australian dim sim versions of foods like the Chinese-inspired dim sim.  3 Oct  My friend and | have arrived in Katherine, a town in Australias Northern Territory. We're here to learn about the life and customs of the Aborigines, who are native to Australia. The Aboriginal population might be small, but its influence is still visible. For example, Bondi in Bondi Beach is an Aboriginal word meaning water breaking over rocks.  To survive in this vast land on the ocean, the Aborigines had to be in close contact with nature. This shows in their music, too, which celebrates the natural world and the  14 UNIT 2 ICONIC ATTRACTIONS spiritual world around them. Most of their musical instruments are really just sticks found on the ground, among which there is an amazing instrument called the didgeridoo.  The didgeridoo is made from a tree branch which is hollow. To play the didgeridoo, you put your mouth on one end and blow while vibrating your lips. Unlike a horn, there are no finger holes. The didgeridoo player has to change the shape of his mouth in order to change pitch. A skilled player can play for a long time without stopping to breathe. He does this by continually breathing in through his nose while breathing out through his mouth and into the didgeridoo. | tried to learn how to play it, but after trying for hours, | was convinced that | could never make a musical sound with this instrument!  6 Oct  It's almost time for me to say goodbye to Australia. I've enjoyed my time here very much. After being here for a while, my biggest impression is the complicated mix of peoples and cultures that make up the nation. Although the main cultural influence since 1788 has been Western culture, minority cultures have also played a part in shaping the unique Australian culture, with many of the new cultural influences contributed by immigrants. It is said that now nearly half of all Australian citizens were either born overseas or have parents who were born overseas.

They have a straightforward and free-and-easy attitude towards life, and their friendliness and warmth made me feel at home wherever | went. 0}  After experiencing Australia, | have to say that | agree with the Take notes  tourism slogan: Theres nothing like Australia.

Below is a passage about the history of the Eiffel Tower before it was considered an iconic attraction. The text contains quite a few verb form  mistakes. Correct the mistakes on your own. Then compare your corrections  with a partner.  The Eiffel Tower is the most famous landmark in France, and one of the most visiting monuments in the world. But it wasnt always so popular. In fact, in 1886, just after its construction was first propose, many were strongly against it. At that time, it would have been the tallest building in the world, and many claim it would destroy the skyline of Paris, or perhaps even destroy some historic landmarks. The chief engineer, Gustave Eiffel, replied say that such a large monument was necessary to symbolise the great efforts of the French people as well as the great advancements in modern engineering, industry, and science. The next year, Eiffel gains approval and the tower was built in time to celebrate the 1889 World Fair in Paris. If you look carefully at the tower, you can still see the names of the 72 scientists, engineers, and mathematicians who help in its construction. Originally, the tower was planned to be taken down after 20 years, but it proved to be too useful as a communications tower, not to mention a giant advertisement board, before finally becomes the iconic attraction that we all know today.

Describe an iconic animal  @) 1 Read the text and then answer the questions on page 21.  THE AMAZING ANIMALS OF TRALIA  Our topic today is Creatures Unique to Australia, with questions answered by wildlife expert, Dr Jim Smith.  Australia has lots of unique animals, but which animal is a symbol of the country?  It has to be the kangaroo, as it has a wide distribution throughout the country. Its a tough animal that has to survive in a difficult environment. Also, it cannot walk backwards, so it is always moving forwards. This expresses the strength and resolve of the Australians as individuals and as a nation. Baby kangaroos weigh only two grammes at birth. They then find their way  UNIT 2 ICONIC ATTRACTIONS 19  Using Language  into their mother's poucha kind of pocketto stay safe and warm. They sleep and drink milk in that temporary, protected environment until they are about seven or eight months old. After this phase, they go out to try their legs. After they learn to jump, they gradually spend less time with their mother and learn to be independent. Kangaroos may look cute, but encounters with them dont always end so well. Kangaroos can hit and kick very hard, so  please folks, if you see some kangaroos, remember they're not for petting!  Koalas are cute, and we see so many pictures of people holding them. But in many places in Australia, it is against the law to even touch them. Can you clarify that?  They are really quite cute, but the truth is, koalas are very sensitive creatures who can easily panic because of even small changes in their environment. They spend quite a lot of time eating, sleeping, and hanging onto tree trunks, so interaction with humans can cause them a lot of stress. Because of this, the government began to make  laws against touching koalas, in the interest of animal protection, as well as public safety. So, if you see one in the wild, you shouldn't approach it to pick it up or even touch it. If you want to hold a koala, you have to go to certain licensed zoos where animal experts make sure that the koalas selected for each session are in a good state for human contact and that they are handled for only a  limited time and on a limited frequency of occasions.  So, weve talked about some cute animals. What about animals which arent so cute?  My favourite is a little creature called the Tasmanian devil. If you are out camping in Tasmania and come across one, the experience might scare you! Tasmanian devils hunt at night, so you won't usually see them, but you may hear their loud cries when they are fighting or eating. The noise they make could wake the dead. Frightening! They are about the size of small dogs and look like rather large black rats. They also have a terrible smell! Their diet is mostly dead animals. Fortunately, despite their name, they  are generally not violent towards people.  20 UNIT 2 ICONIC ATTRACTIONS Australia also has some animals that many people have never heard of, for example, the duck-billed platypus. Is that some kind of bird?  Not at all. While it may lay eggs in a nest like a bird, its really a primitive mammal, with a unique biology. lts eggs hatch after about ten days, and then the baby platypus nurses from its mother like all other mammals. Its nose looks like a ducks bill, and it has feet like a ducks so it can dive under the water, but its covered in hair. Do you know what's really strange about a platypus? The platypus doesnt use its senses of sight or smell to find food. It has a capacity to find food in the water by using electrical sensors in its bill. There are only a small handful of animals in the world that can do that!  When do baby kangaroos begin to spend less time with their mothers?  Why shouldn't you try to pet a wild kangaroo?  What do koalas spend most of their time doing?  Why has the government made it against the law to handle koalas?  What two things about Tasmanian devils can bother people most?  What do Tasmanian devils like to eat?  What makes the way duck-billed platypuses give birth so different from other mammals? What is the unique way used by duck-billed platypuses to find food?

UNIT 2 ICONIC ATTRACTIONS  * Project: Introduce an iconic attraction in your city or town  In groups, brainstorm the kinds of things that people would most like to experience when they travel to a new place. Examples include:   foods * buildings * celebrities   festivals * scenic views * culture  Apart from these, what other kinds of things can you think of?  Do some research and come up with three iconic attractions that may best represent your city or town. Think about what people can experience there.  In groups, compare your lists. Discuss which attractions are the most impressive and representative, and come up with a final list of the top three.  Each of you should write about one attraction from the list and explain why it is worth visiting.  EXAMPLE  DUJIANGYAN  Originally constructed around 256 BCE by the State of Qin as an irrigation and flood control system, Dujiangyan is a remarkable example of ancient engineering skill and is still in use today. During the Warring States period, people who lived along the banks of the Min River were troubled by annual flooding. Qin governor and irrigation engineer Li Bing investigated the problem thoroughly. He led a team to construct a levee to redirect a portion of the river's flow. Then they cut a channel through Mount Yulei to discharge the excess water. After the system was finished, no more floods occurred. What's more, it made Sichuan one of the most productive agricultural regions in China because the redirected water from the Min River could be used for irrigation. If you visit Dujiangyan, you will see an unusual construction that resembles a fishs mouth. This famous attraction, Yuzui, together with two other important parts, namely, Feishayan and Baopingkou, were scientifically designed to control the water flow throughout the year. Recognised as a UNESCO heritage site, Dujiangyan has irrigated farms while preventing floods for over 2,000 years.  5 Give a presentation in class to introduce the city or town. You could even include a video of the attraction.  UNIT 2 ICONIC ATTRACTIONS = 23  * Video Time imu  The Mbantua Festival  Mbantua means awakening the desert.

RELI RN  search for sea routes from west to east. However, merchants  and explorers from the East set sail from east to west many years before Columbus first did.  In ancient times, silk from China found its way overland to India, the Middle East, and Rome, along what became known as the Silk Road. A trading route across the sea was also extended along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, centred around Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Here, merchants from China and many other places met to negotiate trade deals, which  also led to more awareness of each others cultures. Over the centuries, further trading allowed more exploration of the regions to the west of China, as recorded in Du Huans Record of My Travels in the eighth century.  Later, the Ming Dynasty further developed relations with these regions. Between 1405 and 1433, seven large fleets sailed west on voyages of trade and exploration. These fleets were a sight to behold and were in a league of their own at that time. Under the command of Zheng He, they set sail from the South China Sea across the Indian Ocean to the mouth of the Red Sea, and then to the east coast of Africa. African royal families sent gifts such as giraffes as gestures of friendship in return for gold, silk, and spices. Although China withdrew from further expeditions after 1433, these land and sea routes remained  active channels between other cultures for centuries.  To reach out across the sea remains a strong desire today. The ancient sea routes travelled by Zheng He are being revisited with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which is part of the Belt and Road Initiative.  26  The aim of this initiative is to encourage cooperation and trade across the historic Silk Road areas, and strengthen the bonds between China and the rest of the world. Trading  has grown greatly in recent years, and will continue to do so in years to come. China has invested billions in systems and services along these routes, which will help to greatly develop the whole area for the benefit of future trade and cultural exchange.  China has also joined its friends across the sea on other important projects. Although the ancient sea routes of Zheng He have been travelled many times, there are still many other places left to explore. In recent years, China has joined other nations on several expeditions to explore the Arctic. From a scientific point of view, there is an urgent need to study the Arctic in order to understand climate change and its effects.  Hundreds of years on, and with the latest technology in hand, the need to trade and the desire to enhance relationships will drive China to reach out across the sea far into the future.  3 Read the text again.

Sea exploration has caused many problems and will continue to cause more.  More exploration means more pollution. The Deepwater Horizon spilled over 200 million gallons of oil into the sea in 2010. Plastic pollution is also bad, killing many birds and fish, and has even been found in our tap  water.  Mining for resources is very damaging, especially in the Arctic. Because of climate change, there is less ice now, which means we can look for more fossil fuels further north. But if we burn these, the ice will melt more and this negative cycle will continue. Climate change is warning  us that something is very wrong.  Overfishing is another problem. Whales and dolphins are also hunted for their meat or for so- called research. Although this was banned in 1982, some countries are still murdering these intelligent creatures without mercy.  The sea is home to life, not human beings possessions. It is huge, but it is more sensitive than we think. If we  ct it, future generations  Read the two texts below and find the arguments and evidence in them.  Text 2  To truly understand our planet, we must explore the oceans which  cover most of it. Opponents may  be concerned, but sea exploration  is important for our future. For example, scientific research ships can help address important issues such as climate change. We need  to understand what is happening to our planet so that we can take action.  Therefore, more research is necessary.  Understanding more about the sea will also help us manage its resources better. Logging new species will improve our understanding of life on the earth. It may help us discover new medicines, as well as new sources of food and energy. Accessing the deep ocean may also help us to predict  events such as earthquakes.  The population of the world is growing and we need new resources for future development. There are probably vast amounts of resources under the sea and ice, not just oil and gas but also valuable minerals.  Of course, there are still environmental risks. However, these should be balanced with economic needs.

So Ive been here in the jungle for about a month now. My secondary school is a bush school. The classrooms are made of bamboo, with clay floors and roofs of grass. It takes me only a few minutes to walk to school down a dusty track covered in weeds. When | reach the school grounds, Im greeted by a chorus of good morning from the boys. Unlike students in our country, these boys do not wear cotton uniforms, and many of them also have to walk a long way, sometimes for up to two hours, just to get to school.  Theres no electricity, running water or even textbooks, not to mention laptops, tablets, or other modern devices! All the students have are pencils, rubbers, and paper. Im still trying to adapt to these conditions. Ive had to become much more imaginative in my teaching. Science is my most challenging subject as my students have no concept of doing experiments. There is no equipment, and since there isnt even a washroom, if | need water | have to carry it from my house in a basin! Its important not to be too rigid about rules here, too.

Mukap built a fire outside and laid stones on it to heat. He then placed the hot stones in an empty oil drum with kau kau (sweet potato), ripe corn, and greens. He then covered the vegetables with banana leaves and left them to steam. It smelled delicious. We ate inside the hut sitting round the fire. | loved listening to the family talking softly to each other in their language, even though | could not participate much in the conversation. Luckily, Tombe interpreted for us.  Later, | noticed a can standing upside down on the grill over the fire. After a while, Tombe threw it out of the doorway. Tombe told me that the can was heated to dry out the leftover food. His family believes that leftovers attract bad spirits in the night, so any leftover food is dried up in a can and the can is then thrown out of the hut.  We left the village the next morning after many goodbyes and firm handshakes. My muscles were aching and my knees shaking as we dragged ourselves down the mountain towards home.

Read the speech transcript and answer the questions on page 45.  Hello! My name is Zhan Bingbing.  Lately, all of us have seen Chinese people on   } TV in far-off places in the world, helping other countries to develop. We see Chinese workers building roads in the Congo, a port in Pakistan, railways in Panama, and an airport in Sri Lanka. And we see Chinese miners, oil workers, agricultural experts, mechanics, and doctors working in nearly every corner of the world. And some people may ask, Is it worth it? Why help people overseas when China has many areas that are still in need of development?  | had the same questions myself. But for me, it was much more personal. You see, my mother is a medical doctor, and for the last two years, she has been working as a volunteer consultant in Tanzania, Africa, as a part of a medical team sent by the Chinese government.  To be honest, when my mother first left for Africa, | was upset. My mother cooked me dinner every night, and she took good care of me. But more importantly, she was my best friend. We talked together, we spent our leisure time together, and except for school and work, we were never apart. So | was unhappy about her leaving without even asking for my input.  But then | began to hear about the work she was doing in Tanzania, a country that has many health problems, and now | am singing a different tune. Many dangerous diseases which are rare in China are quite commonly contracted in Tanzania. And, while the country is quite beautiful and has much natural wealth, many of the people are quite poor and live without things we take for granted, such as electricity, running water, cars and good transport systems, and supermarkets. One project that my mother worked on was helping to build a cardiac hospital. Prior to this, if a Tanzanian had a heart condition and needed surgery, they would have to go abroad. Since this was quite expensive, many people went without medical treatment and some even died. Now, not only are Tanzanians helped by the hospital, but people in neighbouring countries are helped as well. It has made a big difference to their lives. My mother also does a circuit of the rural villages to provide medical treatment, help those with disabilities, and provide consultation and training for local doctors. In addition, her team has given patients a new malaria treatment invented in China, and this has saved many lives.  Today, | want to relay to you that Im proud of the work my mother has done, and | am now supportive of it. Is her work worth it? Yes, to the lives of the people she is helping, it is worth it.  UNIT 4 SHARING  But by any criteria this work is worth it to us as well, because it shows that we are global citizens interested in world stability, and that we feel responsible for others and are ready to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Everyone deserves a fair chance in life. When | think of all the things that we as Chinese citizens can be most proud of, helping others comes at the top  of this list. Now that | understand how important my mothers work is, I've decided to become a volunteer myself to help people in other lands. In the future, | pray that you will do the same.  Thank you!

A vast lake or even an ocean, spread far beyond where the eye could see. The shore  was lined with shining sand, and was being softly lapped by waves. It was covered with small shells which were once inhabited by the first living beings. Around this sea stood a huge rock wall that was being worn away by the endless action of the waves.  | could see far over this great sea because it was being lit up by a strange light. Not sunlight, of course, as we were deep below the surface. No; with its bright, clear whiteness, the light must have been electric. Under the sky, if it could be called so, being made of rock, were also vast clouds. They were being illuminated by this light, but the light gave no heat, so the place felt rather gloomy. Here we were, shut up inside a cave of a size that could not be estimated. It must have been several miles high.  Human words cannot describe the discoveries of those who have been deep into the earth.

Oh yes! | exclaimed.  | hadnt noticed the many bones, which were being crushed under our feet as we walked. Suddenly | thought, if once these monsters lived here, might some still roam through these gloomy forests? | anxiously surveyed the landscape, but we were the only living creatures in this subterranean world.

Showing us everything from alien worlds to intelligent robots and time  travel, sci-fi films are extraordinary. But how much of this science fiction is also scientific fact? Many sci-fi films are based on fiction: novels, short stories, or comics, which first came from someone's imagination and were often influenced by earlier sci-fi works. However, some films try to make the science they show as realistic and accurate as possible.  The film /nterstellar was a box-office success and was praised for how space travel and other scientific aspects of the plot were represented. The story takes place in the near future when living conditions on Earth threaten the survival of humanity. A brave team of astronauts and scientists begin a dangerous mission to find a new planet for humans to live on. Director Christopher Nolan wanted the film to be as realistic as possible. Why simply imagine things that might happen in space or on an interstellar journey? Why not actually look at the real science there? he said. To make sure as much of the film as possible was grounded in real science, Nolan and his team were helped from the start by physicist Kip Thorne, an expert on Albert Einsteins theories. Thorne provided the correct mathematics for the special effects team to generate the fantastic computer simulations that are seen in the film.  In the real world, the search for other habitable planets has been underway for many years. Space telescopes can identify planets orbiting stars by small changes in the stars light as the planets   UNIT1 SCIENCE FICTION  pass by. These searches have discovered countless planets. The next challenge is to find one that is neither too hot nor too cold, where there is water necessary for life forms to develop. Then the problem is how we would get there. As these stars and planets are many light years away, it would  take hundreds or thousands of years to reach them. Creating a spaceship that could travel at the speed of light would be one option, but in the film, Earth does not have that much time and a quicker route must be found. Thus the problem to be overcome is time itself.  Again, real science provided an answer, which was then brought to the screen in the film. As Einstein famously described, time and space are not two separate things, but exist like a fabric that our universe is made of, called space-time. Objects such as planets and stars bend this fabric, creating the force we know as gravity. When this force is very large, space-time is bent a great deal, making it possible for a short cut, known as a wormhole, to appear. This would allow one to pass from one point in the universe to another without having to cross the space in between, therefore making the journey much quicker. Wormholes are often used in sci-fi stories, appearing as simple holes to pass through, but what would one actually look like? Science tells us it would actually look like a sphere, through which we could see through to the other side, and so this is how it appears in the film.  In the film, such a wormhole mysteriously appears near Saturn. Several astronauts have already been through, with some reporting back on promising planets they have found. The team travels through it to another galaxy in the hope of finding a new home. However, as hours pass on these  distant planets, many years pass on Earth. This is also a realistic depiction of what such interstellar travel would be like, as described by Einsteins theory of relativity. Time moves differently depending on where you are and whether  you are still or moving.  Of course, sometimes real science has to be ignored to make sure that a film, which is only a few hours long, is entertaining and that viewers understand what they see. We cannot know exactly what interstellar travel looks like, but science can give us a good idea. Often, there is a fine line between science fiction and fact, which is always changing as science and technology progress. Things that were only being dreamed of years ago are now part of our everyday lives, such as the Internet, mobile phones, and soon even space travel itself.

To fully appreciate Australian cuisine, you have to consider the unique nature of its wildlife and geography. For one thing, there are the wide plains in the interior of the country, which are home to millions of grazing animals. For another, there is Australias long coastline, which is next to all the riches of the sea. It is no wonder then that much of Australian cuisine centres around red meat and seafood.  One of the most popular red meats in Australia is also unique to the continent: kangaroo. This  may seem strange as the kangaroo is a national symbol of Australia. However, in recent years, kangaroos have increased in number to around 45 million. These kangaroos wander onto the GE roads and into cities, making trouble. Their increased numbers have also harmed plants and : other wildlife. As a consequence, the government is encouraging people to use these animals  as food, and kangaroo has become one of the most popular items on the Australian dinner  table.  As for seafood, many of the first Europeans who came to Australia loved the sea. Perhaps this is one reason why so many Australians live near the coast. Since the coastline is so long, each region has its own dishes that are related to the seafood found in its waters. The list OF ~~ seafood available at the local fish market is like a tour of the coast: salmon, prawns, oysters, # tuna, shark, crab, and many more. However, if you want to really take in the full experience, you should go to the fish market in Sydney early in the morning and see the fish being  prepared for sale. Better yet, you can sign up to go deep-sea fishing.  But then, how is all this food cooked? Perhaps the favourite way of cooking food in  Australia is the barbecue, or barbie. Given the fine weather, Australians love to eat Pe Sn, aie ee  WORKBOOK -     72  __ Whisk the egg whites until they are stiff. Add the salt.

This unusual bird has become a national symbol of the country. New Zealanders themselves are also known all over the world as Kiwis, a nickname they are very proud of. The bird has also lent its name to a small, brown, and egg-shaped fruit, the kiwi fruit, though outside New Zealand, this fruits name is often shortened to kiwi.  The Fruit  The kiwi fruit is actually native to China and was originally collected from the wild for use in medicine. In the early 1900s, the fruit spread from China to New Zealand, where farmers began to grow them for sale. In the 1940s, the Americans and the British stationed in New Zealand during the war discovered this amazing fruit, and soon after that, the kiwi fruit began to be exported to the UK and later to the US. It was when the fruit began to be sold in the US that it received the nickname kiwi fruit, which was quickly shortened to kiwi.  The People  The nickname Kiwi used to refer to the country of New Zealand, but after the First World War, New Zealanders began to be referred to (and to refer to themselves) by the nickname Kiwis. A large part of the reason was that there were some New Zealand soldier units that put a picture of the kiwi (the bird) on their badges. Today, the bird's picture is used on many New Zealand products and is worn on the sports clothes of many national sporting teams.  The Bird  The kiwi bird is nocturnal, waking up and coming out of its nest on the ground to feed only at night. It is the only bird in the world that has its nostrils at the end of its beak. All other birds have them above their beaks, close to their face. The female kiwi holds the world record for laying the largest egg in proportion to its body size. Although the kiwi is only about the size of a chicken, the female lays a single egg almost as big as an ostrich egg. The name kiwi comes from the Maori language and is an imitation of the loud cry the male kiwi makes during the mating season.  Unfortunately, the kiwi is an endangered species. It is threatened by non-native animals, such as cats and dogs, and by the loss of its habitat. Kiwis (the people) are doing their best to save the kiwi (the bird) and there are many programmes in place for this purpose. It would, indeed, be sad if New Zealand's national symbol were to become extinct.  73    WORKBOOK    THE THORN BIRDS (Adapted)  Colleen McCullough |  Paddy and the boys loved it Sometimes they spent days on end riding horses miles away from home and camping at night under a sky so vast and filled with stars.  The grey-brown land was full of life. Kangaroos in flocks of thousands streamed leaping through the trees, taking fences with ease, lovely in their grace and freedom and numbers; emus built their nests in the middle of the grassy plain and walked like giants about their territorial boundaries, taking fright at anything strange and running fleeter than horses away from their dark-green, football-sized eggs; termites built rusty towers like miniature skyscrapers; huge ants with a savage bite poured in rivers down holes in the ground.  The bird life was so rich and varied there seemed no end to new kinds, and they lived not in ones and twos but in thousands upon thousands: tiny green-and-yellow parakeets Fee used to call lovebirds, but which the locals called budgerigars; scarlet-and-blue smallish parrots called rosellas; big pale-grey parrots with brilliant purplish-pink breasts, underwings and heads, called galahs; and the great pure white birds with cheeky yellow  combs called sulphur-crested cockatoos. The strong brown kingfishers called kookaburras laughed joyfully or dived for snakes, their favourite food. They were almost human, all these birds, and completely without fear, sitting in hundreds in the trees looking about with bright intelligent eyes, screaming, talking, laughing, imitating anything that produced a sound.  Fearsome lizards five or six feet long pounded over the ground and leaped easily for high tree branches, as at home off the earth as on it; they were goannas. And there were many other lizards, smaller but some no less frightening, with swollen, bright-blue tongues. Of snakes the variety was almost endless, and the Clearys learned that the biggest and most dangerous-looking were often  the least dangerous, while a little creature a foot long might be a death adder; carpet snakes, copper | snakes, tree snakes, red-bellied black snakes, brown snakes, lethal tiger snakes. i  And insects! Grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, bees, flies of all sizes and sorts, cicadas, gnats, dragontlies, giant moths and so many butterflies! The spiders were terrible, huge hairy things inches across, or small but deadly black things hiding in the toilet; some lived in vast wheeling webs hanging between trees, some rocked inside webs in the grass, others dived into little holes in the ground complete with lids which shut after them.  This, thought the boys excitedly, was life.  UNIT 3 - E SEA EXPLORATION    Using Words and Expressions  1  Match the words with their meanings.

A SEA OF PLASTIC  Scientists visiting tiny Henderson Island in the South Pacific recently made an alarming discovery. Although it is one of the most remote places on the earth and previously untouched by humans, the island was covered in plastic waste. They calculated there were 38 million pieces of plastic, weighing almost 18 tons, with thousands of new pieces washing up each day. No country has a free passwe found plastic from everywhere, said one scientist. We all have a responsibility, and we have to sit up and pay attention. This is not an issue to ignore. We need to do something now to protect the sea.  Plastic waste in the sea has long been known about, but only now are we discovering the true extent of the problem. Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, so all the plastic ever produced still exists somewhere. Around 95% of plastics made are not recycled, and large amounts enter the sea. Currents collect this waste in large circular systems called gyres. One of the largest is in the Pacific Ocean, an area now known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.    UNIT 3 SEA EXPLORATION  The problem gets worse as plastic breaks down into very small pieces, or micro plastic. This is eaten by fish and leads to massive species loss. Humans also eat these fish, and micro plastic has even been found in tap water around the world. The problem has spread too far to ignore. The plastic on Henderson Island accounts for just 2 seconds worth of global annual plastic production. That production will more than triple by 2050. Then there will be the same weight of plastic in the sea as fish.  However, there are some young minds working to clean up and protect the sea for future generations. While diving in Greece, young Boyan Slat noticed there was more plastic waste than fish. He decided right then to dedicate his life to solving this problem. Previously the problem was considered too big to solve; collecting the plastic with boats and nets would be expensive, would harm sea life, and would take thousands of years! But, Boyan thought, why move through the sea when the sea can move through you? To work with the currents and gyres would help collect the waste. So he started The Ocean Cleanup project, which places very long floating barriers in the Pacific. Currents then concentrate the waste naturally so it can be collected and recycled. He hopes to reduce the patch by 50% in just five years.  Many problems today are side effects of things people didnt think about in the past, he says. Sea plastic is a symbol of the negative effects of our lifestyle and technology. Our aim should be to create a new lifestyle for this century. Protecting the sea from plastic is a good place to start!  What alarming discovery did the scientists make? What are gyres?  What is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?  Why does micro plastic make things even worse? How does The Ocean Cleanup project work?  ahon   3 Write an argumentative essay about sea protection.  1 Choose a topic from the box below.

If | feel less helpless today, its because | have seen what can be done and what is being done by UNICEF, by all the other agencies, by the churches, by governments and, most of all, by people themselves.  The effect of the monstrous burden of debt has made the poor even poorer and has fallen most heavily on the neediest, and those whom it has damaged the most are the mothers and children. We must do more about the alarming state in which the children in the developing world are only just surviving, especially when we know that the finances needed are minimal compared to the global expenditure of this world; when we know that less than half of one percent of todays world economy would be the total required to eradicate the worst aspects of poverty and would meet basic human needs over the next 10 years. In other words, there is no deficit in human resources. The deficit is in human will.  The question Im most frequently asked is: What do you really do for UNICEF? Clearly, my task is to inform, to create awareness of the needs of children. To fully understand the problems of the state of the worlds children, it would be nice to be an expert on education, economics, politics, religions, traditions, cultures ... Im none of these things, but | am a mother and will travel.  There is, unhappily, a need for greater advocacy for childrenchildren haunted by malnutrition, disease, and death, and you dont have to be a financial whizz to look into so many little faces with glazed, diseased eyes to know that this is the result of critical malnutrition, one of the worst symptoms of which is vitamin A deficiency, that causes corneal lesions resulting in partial or total blindness, followed by death within a few weeks. Every year, there are as many as 500,000 such cases in countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, and Ethiopia. Today there are in fact two hundred million children at risk of going blind. Little wonder that | and many other UNICEF volunteers travel the world to raise funds before its too late, but also to raise awareness and to combat a different kind of darknessa darkness people find themselves in through lack of information on how easy it is to reach out and help these children. It costs eighty-four cents a year to stop a child from going blindthe price of two vitamin A capsules.  | have known UNICEF for a long time. In fact, almost 45 years ago, | was one of the tens of thousands of children in war-ravaged Europe to receive aid from UNICEF immediately after our  87 liberation, a liberation that freed us from hunger, repression, and constant violence, and we were reduced to near total poverty, as is the developing world today. It is poverty that is at the root of all their sufferingnot having the means to help themselves, and that is what UNICEF is all about: helping people to help themselves, giving them the aid to develop, and thereby allowing them to become self-reliant and live in dignity.  Unlike droughts, floods, or earthquakes, the tragedy of poverty cannot easily be captured by the media and brought to the attention of the worldwide public. It is happening not in any one particular place, but in slums and shanties and neglected rural communities across two continents. It is happening not at any one particular time but over long years of increasing poverty, which have not been featured in the nightly news but which have changed the lives of many millions of people.  UNICEF's business is children, not the workings of the international economy. In its everyday work in over 100 developing nations, UNICEF is brought up against the face of todays international economic problems which is not seen in the corridors of financial power, not reflected in the statistics of debt service ratios, not seated at the conference tables of debt negotiations. It is in the face of a child. It is the young child whose growing mind and body is susceptible to permanent damage from even temporary deprivation. The human brain and body are formed within the first five years of life and there is no second chance. It is the young child whose individual development today and whose social contribution tomorrow are being shaped by the economics of now. It is the young child who is paying the highest of all prices.  If we are meant to love thy (your) neighbour as thyself, then surely we should love these children as our own, Children are our most vital resource, our hope for the future. Children cannot wait. They are too fragile to wait for an economic crisis to pass. Their time is running out. We must help them now not only to survive, but to hope and perhaps even to dream. Every child has a right to health, to tenderness, and to life.  Thank you!

What are your opinions on the subject?  DOES PRACTICE REALLY MAKE PERFECT?  Practice makes perfect is a very popular expression. However, can we take this saying literally? Many scientific studies have sought to either prove or disprove this idea. So does enough practice literally lead to perfection, or at least to a level of expertise?  One popular theory is that if a person practises for at least 10,000 hours, they will reach perfection or, in other words, become an expert in their field. This theory was made famous by Malcolm Gladwell in his 2008 best-selling book, Outliers: The Story of Success. He claimed 40,000 hours of practice to be the magic number of greatness. He gave the examples of the music group The Beatles and Microsoft co-creator Bill Gates. Although they all seemed to have lots of natural talent, they also clearly put in over 10,000 hours of practice before they became successful.  However, Gladwells book has been said by many to be too simplistic and generalising. Gladwells work was largely based on research done by Anders Ericsson, who argued that Gladwell misinterpreted his research. Firstly, Ericsson stated that 10,000 hours was an average figure. Some people, for example, needed far fewer than 10,000 hours, and others many more. More importantly, Ericsson said that just practising a lot was not enough; the type and quality of practice was also essential. He went on to explain the importance of deliberate practice, which is when a person practises a specific part of a skill in depth rather than practising a skill as a whole. Deliberate practice is said to be much more effective, albeit more tiring.  Despite the theories mentioned above, many other studies argue that practice alone is far from enough. In fact, a more recent study from Princeton University stated that practice only accounted for up to 26% of reaching an expert level. So what are the other factors that contribute to people becoming experts?  : - UNIT5 LAUNCHING YOUR CAREER ws  Many people say that natural talent has a large influence on becoming an expert. Another natural factor is physical superiority, which is especially evident in sports. For instance, many baseball players in America have amazing vision that allows them to see the ball much sooner than others do. So no matter how much a normal person practises, it is very hard for them to be as good as someone who has natural talent or physical superiority and who also practises.  And how about other factors that go into creating an expert? Many say IQ, personality, attitude, and Starting age are decisive factors, too. It is also important to note that becoming an expert doesnt equal instant success. Success also relies on social factors, environmental factors, and even just being in the right place at the right time!  In conclusion, practice may not make perfect, but deliberate practice has been shown to lead to significant improvement. Based on Ericsson's research, here are some tips on how to practise effectively: be motivated; make specific and realistic goals; work outside your comfort zone; be consistent and persistent; ask for others opinions; and, of course, get plenty of rest! For those wanting to become an expert in something, remember that being motivated is keyenjoy what you do and follow your passions.  2 Read the text and answer these questions.  1 What is the rough idea of the 10,000 hours theory?

THE SUMMER BREAK THAT COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE  After finishing high school and before going on to further education or the world of work, there will be a break over the summer. Using this break wisely can be very beneficial. In fact, it could even change your life. If used correctly, the break will give you some great experiences and help you think about what you want to do with your life. So lets take a look at some summer break options and some tips on getting it right.  Working The world of work can feel more stressful than school, but it definitely has its rewards. Many people work during their break to earn money, often for their further education. Others work to get valuable work experience. Finding a temporary work placement in a company will gain you some great experience, and you may even be able to return to the company in the future. There are also some fun choices. For example, working at a summer camp is a popular way to earn a little money, gain some experience, and make friends at the same time.  Volunteering Being a volunteer usually means doing important work in the service of others. Volunteering is often quite challenging, but its an extremely rewarding experience to give something back to society. Take teaching children in a remote village, for example. Helping the students learn new things will give you a great sense of achievement. Try to volunteer in a field that you are interested in, as this may help your future career and make future employers respect you more. But be careful to check the details of any voluntary work that is away from home or overseas. Some organisations provide you with free food and lodgings, but others do not, which means that you may need to pay to be a volunteer!  Studying Yes, you could go back to school! Not necessarily the same school as before, but a place where you could take a specialised course in something youre really interested in. Its a great chance to get an extra qualification for your CV. Aside from that, it will give you a better insight into the subject area and make you more experienced than others.  Travelling Travelling will build your confidence and broaden your horizons. Backpacking is a very popular and cheap way for young people to travel. There are plenty of helpful websites and travel guides. Most backpackers stay in international youth hostelssafe, cheap, and friendly places to stay, which also usually offer food, ticket bookings, and tours.  It's up to you where you travel, too. You can travel overseas or in your own country, either of which will bring great experiences. But why is travel so important? For centuries, famous writers and   UNITS LAUNCHING YOUR CAREER  thinkers have written about the importance of travel.  Travel leads to great stories, photos, and friends. It  also gives you a fresh perspective on where you are from. Although it does cost money, it is a character- building experience that gives you time to think and develop, and you cannot put a price on great  memories.  TOP TIPS  It is very important to use the summer break effectively. The break should be seen as an extended part of your education. You can learn about the world, adult life, and, most importantly, yourself. You could also obtain some valuable work experience, and it could possibly lead to great changes in your life. Good planning is key, so remember these tips:   Be focused. An effective break should follow your interests or area of study. It will bring you more satisfaction and help contribute to your future.  e Be organised. Before your break starts, do some research and make a plan. This in itself develops important life skills. Take travel for example. You have to find out about the destination, how to get there, where to stay, how much things will cost, and so on and so forth.  e Be smart. You dont have to choose just one option. For example, perhaps you could find paid or voluntary work that is away from home, which will also give you Lots of travel experience.  e Be money-minded. Will you spend money or save it? Will you need to borrow money? Budgeting, or controlling how you spend money, is an essential life skill to master.  e Be safe. If you're going to be away from home, make sure you go to a reputable place. Always let your parents know where you are. Its best to travel with friends, too.   Be happy! Although planning an effective summer break can be stressful, it is essential to ensure that you have a safe and pleasant time! Remember that its important to do something that interests you, as it will enable you to gain experience and have fun at the same time.  So start thinking and planning now, and make this summer break one that could change yout life!  96  Appendices  Notes   Unit 1  SATISFACTION GUARANTEED (@ (iis)             .
