A SHORT HISTORY OF WESTERN PAINTING  What is Western art? It is hard to give a precise definition. As there have been so many different styles of Western art, it is impossible to describe them all in a short text. Perhaps the best way to understand Western art is to look at the development of Western painting over the centuries.  The Middle Ages (from the 5th to the 15th century)  During the Middle Ages, the purpose of Western art was to teach people about Christianity. Thus, artists were not interested in painting realistic scenes. Their works were often primitive and two-dimensional, and the main characters were often made much larger than everyone else to show their importance. This began to change in the 13th century with Giotto di Bondone (1267-1337). While his paintings still had religious themes, they showed real people in a real environment. In particular, his paintings are set apart from other paintings by their realistic human faces and deep emotional impact.  The Renaissance (from the 14th to the 17th century)  New ideas and values gradually replaced old ones from the Middle Ages. As a result, painters concentrated less on religious themes. They began to adopt a more humanistic attitude to life. An important breakthrough during this period was the use of perspective by Masaccio (1401-1428). Influential painters such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), Michelangelo (1475-1564), and Raphael (1483-1520) built upon Giotto and Masaccios innovations to produce some of the greatest art that Europe had ever seen.  Another innovation was the use of oil paints. With their deep colours and realism, some of the best oil paintings look like photographs. While painters as early as Da Vinci had used oil, this technique reached its height with Rembrandt (1606-1669), who gained a reputation as a master of shadow and light.  In subject matter, the emphasis increasingly shifted from religious themes to people and the world around us. Kings, nobles, and people of high rank wanted to purchase accurate pictures of themselves and the people they loved. Others wanted paintings showing important historical events or stories from mythology. Finally, most clients wanted paintings that were beautiful and interesting to look at.  Self-Portrait with Shaded Eyes  UNIT 1 ART  Impressionism (late 19th to early 20th century)  The development of Western art slowed until the invention of photography in the mid-19th century. After that, paintings were no longer needed to preserve what people and the world looked like. Hence, painters had to find a new way of looking at their art. From this, Impressionism emerged in France. The name of this new movement came from the painting by Claude Monet (1840-1926) called Impression, Sunrise. In this work, Monet's aim was to convey the light and movement in the scenethe subjective impression the scene gave himbut not a detailed record of the scene itself.  Impression, Sunrise  While many Impressionists painted scenes of nature or daily life, others, such as Renoir (1841- 1919), focused on people. Unlike the cold, black-and-white photographs of that time period, Renoir's paintings are full of light, shadow, colour, and life. He sought to show not just the outer image of his subjects, but their inner warmth and humanity as well.  Modern Art (from the 20th century to today)  After Impressionism, subsequent artists began to ask, What do we do next? Painters such as Picasso (1881-1973) tried to analyse the shapes which existed in the natural world but in a new way, with Cubism. Others gave their paintings a realistic but dream-like quality. Still others turned to abstract art. What they attempted to do was no longer show reality, but instead to ask the question, What is art?

Join us as we explore more than 3,000 years of wonderful art from the Middle Kingdom. From bronze bowls to ceramic vases, and jade sculptures to ink wash  paintings, our goal is to display the Chinese artistic genius from ancient times.  The highlight of this exhibition is the painting Clearing After Snow on a Mountain Pass, one of the great works of Tang Yin (1470-1524). Born during  the Ming Dynasty, Tang sought and failed to gain entry into the civil service,  so he turned to painting instead. In time, he gained recognition as one of the greatest artists China has ever known. This painting, showing high mountains, | trees, and houses covered in snow, was made with extraordinary skill. Though it  is over 500 years old, it looks as fresh and full of life as the day it was created.  Also of primary note is a collection of nearly 100 bronze objects from the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE-1046 BCE). While the artists who made these great works are not known, they showed great skill in creating these beautiful pieces. Some of the  items on display are thought to have come from the collection of Emperor Qianlong (1711-1799), a great admirer of Shang Dynasty bronze.  Finally, we have many fine examples of Tang Dynasty (618-907) sculptures. Most of these are of Buddhist origin. Even though Buddhism entered China much earlier, it did not really begin to show expansion until the seventh century. During this same period, trade along the Silk Road also boomed. Chinese sculpture thus found itself highly influenced by Buddhist art brought from India and Central Asia through the Silk Road. These works were intended to spread Buddhism and they are of exceptional beauty and quality. Looking at the faces of the figures in these  sculptures, one sees the faces of the past. History is brought to life.  This is just a small taste of what is in store for you in this exhibition. We guarantee that From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages will transport you to another time with its amazing collection of works.  From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages will run until November 25.  Opening hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., from Tuesday to Sunday (the museum is closed on Mondays).

SDSS LEDER STB SEDER TRI RES CORES  |_| F What a habit is [_] G Why bad teenage habits should be changed  HABITS FOR A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE  As teenagers grow up, they become more independent and start making their own decisions. However, during this period, it can be easy for some of them to form bad habits. These bad habits, if left unchecked, could lead to more serious ones when they become adults. For example, some of them may become involved in tobacco or alcohol abuse, which can lead to physical and mental health problems. To prevent harmful habits like these from dominating a teenager's life is essential. They must learn to recognise bad habits early and make appropriate changes.  To change bad habits is never easy, even with many attempts. There is a famous saying based on the philosophy of Aristotle: We are what we repeatedly do. In many ways, our lifestyle is the sum of choices we have made. We make a choice to do something, and then we repeat it over and over again. Soon that choice becomes automatic and forms a habit that is much harder to change. The good news is that we can change, if we understand how habits work.  According to modern psychology, we must first learn about the habit cycle, which works like this:   Firstly, there is a cue, an action, event, or / ~\  situation that acts as a signal to do something. THE HABIT   Secondly, there is a routine, the regular action CYCLE (Str  you take in response to the cue.  Thirdly, there is the reward, the good thing or  feeling we get from the routine.  14 UNIT 2 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE  For example, when we feel unhappy (cue), we eat lots of unhealthy snacks (routine), which makes us feel happy (reward). The reward makes us much more likely to continue the cycle, and the bad habit of relying on unhealthy snacks is formed.  To facilitate a positive change in our bad habits, we must first examine our bad habit cycles and then try to adapt them. We can do this by combining the information from our habit cycles with our own positive ideas. For example, we could try to replace a negative routine with something more positive. So, when we feel unhappy again (cue), rather than eat snacks, we could listen to some of our favourite music instead (routine), which will make us feel relaxed (reward). Aside from changing bad habits, we can also use the habit cycle to create good habits. For example, when we come to an escalator (cue), our normal routine is to ride it, but we could change this routine into something more positive by taking the stairs instead.  Many of us try to change bad habits quickly, and if we are not successful straight away, we often become pessimistic and give up. In fact, the most successful way to change is not suddenly, but over a period of time. As the Chinese philosopher Lao Zi wrote, A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. One step seems small, but it is essential. To reach the goal of change, a person must show some discipline and repeatedly take many small steps. After all, it is not easy to break bad habits.  For young people, there is plenty of time to change bad habits. However, there is no magic pill or delete button that will help you; you have to think about your bad habits and decide on some changes. You have the power to build a happy and healthy life full of good habits!  Read the text again and answer the questions.  1 How can a choice lead to a habit?

Read the letters and then complete the chart on page 21.  Dear Editor,  After I attended your summer camp about health and lifestyle choices, I realised I hardly ever felt well, either physically or mentally. I often felt sleepy and dizzy, and lacked passion. Most worrying, though, I got the flu easily and experienced many toothaches, too.  At the end of the camp I heard, Change the world by changing yourself. This stimulated my motivation. A dentist once examined me and told me that too much sugar in my meals had damaged my teeth and health. I made up my mind to change two things in my life: to eat nothing with sugar and to exercise regularly.  After that I stopped buying all the sweets, biscuits, and sugary drinks that I used to have every day. Whenever I went out with friends, I brought snacks from home, things that didnt have any added sugar: fruit, nuts, dried meat, etc.  My exercise was very simple: I went outside every day for at least 30 minutes and did something active. Sometimes I played table tennis or badminton with my cousins. Other times I jumped on my skateboard and rode around my neighbourhood, or just took a long walk.  The results have been fantastic. I feel more dynamic and stronger than ever, in both body and mind. I sleep soundly at night now. I no longer suffer from a flu virus or toothaches either. Best of all, in my opinion, is how I feel about myself. I feel like Im in control of my own life. To make choices about myself is within my own power. I CAN change myself. I just need to try.  SN RN NSs  AY  UNIT 2 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE  Dear Editor,  As I took part in the summer camp about personal life choices, I started to analyse my choices, especially what I did to relax and how it was affecting my whole life.  After starting high school, I felt stressed out and always relaxed by playing computer games. I got so absorbed that I played the games day and night. Playing was fun, but I felt even more worn out afterwards! So after the camp, I realised that it was very, very important to adjust my lifestyle. I decided to take control of my life and find other ways to relax.  It was a big struggle not to join my friends in playing online games as Im mad for them. However, I realised that to succeed in quitting, I had to replace it with something else. So I thought about what to try. Rock climbing, bowling, watching comedies, and playing  _ basketball were the things I thought of doing  instead.  Now my dad and I go rock climbing together monthly! It has enhanced the quality of my life, improving my health and increasing my happiness. I get refreshed through climbing, spend more time with my dad, and get to meet new friends.  After six months of trying out new ways of relaxing, I feel much more energetic. I feel that I can change myself for the better. And if thats true for me, then it might truly be possible to change the world for the better. As Gandhi said, Be the change you want to see in the world.

What are the consequences of high greenhouse gas emissions?  Why did the author mention the climate scientists warning?  What is the author's purpose of writing this text?  OP   CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES THE WORLD S ATTENTION  We have known about climate change for decades. There is little doubt that Earth is getting warmer and warmer (see the graph). A warming ocean and atmosphere along with melting ice and rising sea levels provide evidence of a dramatic change in the global climate.  Global Surface Temperature: 1920-2016 Base Period  1920 1928 1936 1944 1952 1960 1968 1976 1984 1992 2000 2008 2016 YEAR  In 2013, a lot of people were shocked by a news photo of a dead polar bear that was found on Norways Arctic island of Svalbard. According to the scientists who found its dead body, all that remained of the polar bear was skin and bones. An expert who has studied polar bears for many years said that from the position of its dead body, the bear appeared to have starved and died. Experts claimed that low sea-ice levels caused by climate change meant the bear could not hunt seals as before, so it had to travel greater distances in order to find food. This alarming case showed how the increase in temperature had an impact on Earths ecology.  Then what is causing the increase in the global average surface temperature? Climate scientists often mention a key climate process called the greenhouse effect, which has two common meanings: the natural greenhouse effect and the man-made greenhouse effect. The natural  greenhouse effect refers to the fact that heat from the sun enters the atmosphere and warms  Earths surface as short-wave radiation. The heat is released back into space at longer wave lengths. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as methane and carbon dioxide, trap some of the heat, keeping Earths climate warm and habitable. Without this process, Earth could not sustain life. However, the man-made greenhouse effect has now become a big problem. When people produce huge amounts of extra greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels, more heat energy is trapped in the atmosphere and causes Earths surface temperature to rise quickly.  There is strong and comprehensive evidence that the rise in temperature has led to an increase in extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide, not only causing serious damage, but also costing human lives. Climate scientists have warned that if we do not take appropriate actions, this warming trend will probably continue and there will be a higher price to pay. In fact, news reports are frequently broadcast about extreme rainstorms and heatwaves causing deaths and economic losses.  Continued greenhouse gas emissions will result in further warming and long-lasting changes to the global climate. This requires the attention of people all over the world. Governments need to consider making policies and taking appropriate actions and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We as individuals can also reduce our carbon footprint by restricting the amount of carbon dioxide our lifestyles produce. It is our responsibility to seize every opportunity to educate everyone about global warming, along with its causes and impacts, because this is the most serious issue affecting all of us on this planet. So what will you do to help?  3 Read the text again and create a diagram describing how the greenhouse effect works.  0  Draw a diagram  Diagrams are very useful tools that can be used to brainstorm ideas, map out processes, show cause and effect relationships, explain a new idea or concept, and so on.

Have you ever been there? 2 What do you think might have caused water pollution in the Li River?  2 Read the report and then answer the questions.  REDUCING WATER POLLUTION IN THE LI RIVER  The beautiful Li River and its amazing surrounding scenery is one of the most well- known tourist destinations in China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It attracts millions of domestic and foreign visitors each year. However, its reputation as a top destination has had negative effects on the river's water quality. This report looks at the problem of water pollution and some actions that have been taken to deal with if.  Previously, water quality in the Li River had suffered greatly from an increasing volume of tourists, many of whom frequently threw garbage into the river. Many tour boats contributed to the problem too. Kitchens on board were using lots of oil, which was often thrown into the water. The growth in tourism also meant the local population rose rapidly, as well as the number of commercial and industrial enterprises. Water pollution levels increased, with more household and commercial waste ending up in the river. In order to feed more people, more chemicals were used to increase crop production. These chemicals led to severe water quality issues, causing a decrease in the number of fish species. Local officials were concerned that the pollution was damaging the natural environment and felt that urgent steps should be taken to restore the river's original beauty.  A comprehensive initiative was started, with a number of measures that addressed the issues. The construction of waste water treatment facilities improved the water quality and water conservation. The collection and transport of household waste was also improved. Dozens of polluting enterprises were closed or moved. The local government set up strict regulations regarding further industrial development. New rules were also introduced regarding tour boat routes and garbage disposal methods. Furthermore,  the local authorities began to use the media to spread environmental awareness and encourage greater use of clean energy. At the same time, they started to carry out inspections regularly and fine tourist organisations for abuses. With these measures, it is believed that the beauty of the Li River will be preserved for generations to come.  In addition, the ambitious Water Ten Plan is also now tackling water pollution across the country. Other initiatives, such as the River Chief System", hold senior officials responsible for reducing water pollution. With such campaigns in effect, Chinas waterways are heading towards a clean and sustainable future.  1 What were some of the negative effects on the Li River as a result of the growth in tourism? 2 What measures have been taken to improve the Li Rivers water quality? 3 What is the River Chief System?

And when the ship sank, our hearts sank with it.  :   Before we abandoned the ship, Shackleton calmly called us together and told us to rescue our most essential suppliesthe small boats, our food, the cook stove, candles, clothes, 7 and blankets. This was no time to panic. We were not allowed to take most of our personal belongings, and Shackleton himself threw away all his gold. But to our surprise, he allowed  Hussey to keep his banjo.

In pairs, predict what happened to the crew members. Then read the memoir below to see if your predictions were correct.  THE REWARD FOR PERSEVERANCE  We watched as Shackleton and the boat sailed away from Elephant Island. It was easy to imagine the danger ahead of them. Would they ever return to find us? What might happen to them? What if they were delayed? We felt so alone and desperate. But it was not for long. There was nothing like a good dinner and some music to cheer us up.  Life fell into a regular pattern. Staying alive took all our time and energy. For example, we needed water, and Elephant Island had none. We found that we could melt ice from the ocean and drink the water from it. But how could we make fire? There were no trees growing on Antarctica and no oil, so the only fuel we could use was animal fat. This gave off oily, black smoke, but it stayed burning even in strong winds.  Food was also a problem, as we did not find any vegetables or fruit on the island. One of our group members, Lionel Greenstreet, noted in his diary about how bored he was with the meals: The food now is pretty well all meat of sea creatures. If it weren't for sea animals, we would all starve. As a chef, it was my duty to cook, so 1 tried to vary the meals in whatever way | could. But it was difficult.  We had to be careful not to go outside too often, as the changing temperatures could make us ill. It was almost as dangerous to become too hot from wearing too many clothes as to become too cold from wearing too few. The sweat could freeze very quickly. Many of us also became ill from the black smoke of the animal fat we burnt for our fires. It damaged our eyes and burnt our lungs.  i  3 Point Wild, where Shackletons men were rescued in 1916  if  44 UNIT 4 ADVERSITY AND COURAGE The twenty-two of us lived like this in the cold for four months. Our discipline and team spirit kept us optimistic and helped us deal with our fears in a positive and successful way. We also celebrated our birthdays, festivals, and even the times when we caught asea animal. This was an episode in my life that 1 would never forget.  When we were finally rescued, we felt such relief and joy that many of us could not hide our tears. We were at last free to go home to warm beds, good food, and the care of our family and friends. Our optimism and faith in Shackleton had helped us persevere in  staying alive. And he paid us back by his commitment to save us from a slow but painful death.  2 Read the text again and answer the following questions.  What did the men eat and drink on the island?

A FEW SIMPLE FORMS OF ENGLISH POEMS  There are various reasons why people compose poetry. Some poems tell a story or describe a certain image in the reader's mind. Others try to convey certain feelings such as joy and sorrow. The distinctive characteristics of poetry often include economical use of words, descriptive and vivid language, integrated imagery, literary devices such as similes and metaphors, and arrangement of words, lines, rhymes, and rhythm. Poets use many different forms of poetry to express themselves. Now we will look at a few of the simpler forms.  Some of the first poems a young child learns in English are nursery rhymes. They are usually the traditional poems or folk songs. The language of these rhymes, like Poem A, is to the point but has a storyline. Many children enjoy nursery rhymes because they rhyme, have a strong rhythm, and often repeat the same words. The poems may not make sense and even seem contradictory, but they are easy to learn and recite. By playing with the words in nursery rhymes, children learn about language.  One of the simplest kinds of poem is the list poem, which contains a list of things, people, ideas, or descriptions that develop a particular theme. List poems have a flexible line length and repeated phrases which give both a pattern and a rhythm to the poem. Some rhyme (like B and C), while others do not.  UNIT 5 POEMS  Hush, little baby, dont say a word, Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird. fthat mockingbird won't sing,  Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring. Ifthat diamond ring turns to brass, Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass. If that looking-glass gets broke, Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat. Ifthat billy goat wont pull,  Papas gonna buy you a cart and bull.  Mother  Hundreds of stars in the deep bifesey Hundreds of shells on the shore together, Hundreds of birds that go singing by, Hundreds of bees in the sunny weather, Hundreds of dewdrops to greet the dawn,  Hundreds of bees in the purple clover, Hundreds of butterflies on the lawn,  But only one mother the world over.  George Cooper  LIFE  Life can be good,  Life can be bad, Life is mostly cheerful,  Sitting in court.  Another simple form of poem that amateurs can easily write is the cinquain, which is made up of five lines. With these, you can convey a strong picture or a certain mood in just a few words. Look at the example (D).  Haiku is a Japanese form of poetry that consists of 17 syllables. It has a format of three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively. It is not a traditional form of English poetry, but is very popular with English writers. It is easy to write and, like the cinquain, can give a clear picture and create a special feeling using very few words. The haiku poem (E) on the right is a translation from Japanese, which shows a moment in the life of a delicate butterfly.  English speakers also enjoy poems from China, those from the Tang Dynasty in particular. A lot of Tang poetry has been translated into English, such as this one (F].  With so many different forms of poetry to choose from, you may eventually want to write poems of your own. Give it a try!

Should the traveller return,  this stone would utter speech. in ; Wang Jian <> ie,  Poems paint pictures with words through the use of figures of speech and metaphors, so to understand a poem fully, you have to imagine in your mind the picture the poem is painting. Further, the sounds, rhythm, and rhymes in a poem give it a musical quality. Poems often have to be read  aloud, and with feeling, to be really understood and enjoyed.

It is known to people in China.  2 There are also many poems written from a childs perspective. In these poems the poet Tagore shows a sympathetic understanding of childrens feelings.  3 The English version of the book contains nearly 50 poems. The focus of the poems is on the parent-child relationship.  4 The initial poems were written from the perspective of a mother. The mother loves her baby at play and at rest, in laughter and in tears.  5 Many people love to read this collection of poems. The reason is that they can feel the warmth of love and enjoy the innocence of childhood.  6 It was written by the Indian poet Tagore. Tagore was the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.  Read the following introduction about the Brownings. Help the author edit the passage to make it more concise, using relative clauses if necessary.  If you study the history of English literature, you will find the names of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. They were one of the most romantic literary couples of the Victorian era. Elizabeth Barrett started to write poetry from about the age of six. In 1844, Elizabeths Poems brought her great success. It also attracted the admiration of poet Robert Browning. Browning fell in love with her poetry and then they entered into personal correspondence. The couple exchanged many letters. These letters obviously helped sow the seeds of love between the two. Elizabeth had been ill for many years. She stayed at home and almost never saw visitors. Browning was sure about his love, so he found a way to visit her, and immediately convinced her to become his bride. However, their subsequent marriage was carried out in secret. It was because Barretts father was a dominant and selfish man. He would refuse to let his daughter go. The couple moved to Italy in 1846. Elizabeth lived there for the rest of her life. Browning had a great influence on Elizabeths writing. The best evidence that can be found is Sonnets from the Portuguese. The sonnets were written during the time when she was in love with Robert Browning.  Work in pairs. Describe your favourite Chinese poets using sentences that contain relative clauses.  EXAMPLE __ Bai Juyi was one of the greatest Chinese poets who ever lived. He was born during the mid-Tang Dynasty, which was a period of rebuilding and recovery for the Tang Empire.

Begin to think about how the poem makes you feel happy, sad, in loveand read the poem with emotion, pouring out your feelings.  o Pronunciation  THE ARROW AND THE SONG  | shot an arrow into the air, It fell to earth, | knew not where; For, so swiftly it flew, the sight  Could not follow it in its flight.  | breathed a song into the air, t fell to earth, | knew not where; For who has sight so keen and strong,  That it can follow the flight of song?  Long, long afterwards, in an oak | found the arrow, still unbroke;  And the song, from beginning to end,  found again in the heart of a friend.  H. W. Longfellow  (Listen and practise reading the following poems aloud. Pay attention to the rhyming words and the rhythm of the poems.  NIGHT The sun descending in the west, The evening star does shine; The birds are silent in their nest, And | must seek for mine. The moon, like a flower, In heaven's high bower, With silent delight,  Sits and smiles on the night.  Farewell, green fields and happy groves, Where flocks have took delight.  Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves The feet of angels bright;  Unseen, they pour blessing,  And joy witout ceasing,  On each bud and blossom,  And each sleeping bosom.  55 Using Language  Write a poem  1 Before you read, discuss how to understand a poem with your partner.

Swinburne  56 UNIT5 POEMS Wind on the Hill Dream A Match  Subject Images Rhyming words  Rhetorical devices  3 Choose one of the poems and write a short essay about it. The following example may help you.  The poem Dream by Langston Hughes is very short with only 8 lines. When I read the poem aloud I can hear that the ends of the second and fourth sentences rhymedie and fly. The last word from the sixth and eighth sentences also rhymego and  snow. These rhyming words sound nice and make the poem pleasing to read.  When I close my eyes, I can see different images from the poem. For example, I can see two hands being held. I can see a bird flying in the sky. I can see a field and I can imagine what it looks like with lots of snow. I start to feel cold when I read these lines!  I learnt a new phrase, hold fast, which means to hold onto something. Barren is also  anew word to me, which means empty.  I think the poet is giving us advice. He wants us to keep dreaming, because life is much  better when we dream and have something to look forward to.  Write your own poem by following these steps.  Start with the theme first. Ask yourself, What message do | want to give to the reader? What is important to me?  Next, think about the words and phrases you would like to use. Make a list of words related to your theme.  Then check how well your details paint a picture in your head. Now write the poem. Read it aloud and listen to how it sounds.  Finally, give it a title. Now your poem is ready!  5 Work in groups.

In that  , there were no TVs or films, and writing had not been invented, so people would sit around the fire at night and sing songs to entertain themselves. These songs reflected themes from the peoples daily lives, such as hunting animals or crops. Since nothing was written down, over the years different of these songs developed, and each area would have its own rhythm. In addition to this, people would stories of past heroes. As these stories were often quite long, they often had and rhythm to help people remember them more easily. While in the beginning such songs and stories had a very simple , over time they became more complicated and more polished. These were no longer the works of sitting around a fire, but works of true poets who cared about their art and who sometimes made a living from it.  2 Read the conversations below and write a short description about the poetry or the poet they are talking about.

The first has been done for you.  THE STARRY NIGHT  Perhaps my favourite painting is The Starry Night, by Vincent van Gogh (1853 1890). Born in the Netherlands, Van Gogh had always been interested in art, and tried to live as a professional painter starting from 1883. His early work was dark = and sad, so in 1886 Van Goghs brother Theo invited him to come to live in Paris. Theo hoped that the bright colours of the Impressionist movement there would influence his work. Van Gogh moved to the south of France in 1888. Later that  year, he suffered a mental collapse and went to live in a hospital. He made more than twenty paintings of the view from his hospital window, during all times of the day and all kinds of weather. However, he only made one painting of the scene at night. As Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo in June, 1889, This morning | saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big. The morning star Van Gogh referred to was actually the planet Venus. Van Gogh had longed to paint a night scene, and the sight  of Venus inspired him.  On the left side of The Starry Night, there is a large tree which shoots up from the 1 ground like a dark fire. It reaches all the way to the top of the painting. In the background are rolling hills, with a small village in a valley. In the centre of the village is a white church. Its tower points up into the sky like a sharp knife. Here and there, you can see houses with windows shining with yellow light. Above all this is dark blue sky. A quarter moon fills the top-right corner of the painting with yellow. Venus sits low near the tree. It burns with white light. Here and there in the sky above Venus are yellow, orange, and red stars. Around these are lines of pure paint in different shades of blue, yellow, and white. They flow out of control, like river rapids.  The Starry Night is not a realistic painting of the scene Van Gogh saw out of his window. For example, in real life there is no village in that valley. However, perhaps the painting shows the deeper reality of what Van Gogh could see with his minds eye. Though the scene is dark and quiet, the painting is full of light and life. It gives us a look, perhaps, into the complex mind and genius of Van Gogh. SS = an  UNIT1 ART -  1 When did Vincent van Gogh decide to try to live as a professional painter? In 1883.  2 ? Van Goghs early work was dark and sad.  3 ? The sight of Venus inspired him to paint The Starry Night.  4 ?  In real life there is no village in that valley. In groups, think of more questions and try to answer them.  2  Inliterary descriptions, the simile is one of the most commonly used figures of speech.

In your second paragraph, give your opinion of the painting.  65   WORKBOOK      66  *Expanding Your World  MICHELANGELO'S DAVID  Most people agree that one of the greatest statues ever made was Michelangelos David, in Florence, Italy. David was a hero in the Bible. As a young boy, he fought and killed a giant, Goliath ( %#!Z ), using only a sling and a small rock, inspiring his army to victory.  The Florence Cathedral first decided to have the statue made in 1464 to stand on its roof, along with statues of other heroes from the Bible. Consequently, they purchased a block of white marble more than 5 metres in length and 6,000 kilograms in weight. Over the years, two different sculptors attempted to work on the statue. However, both gave up, complaining that the marble was of poor quality. Worse yet, it appeared that the last sculptor had ruined the marble by cutting a huge hole in it for the gap between David's legs. The hole had an odd shape, and left very little material on either side to work with. Everyone thought it would be impossible to carve the statues legs properly, and that they would be too thinunable to hold the weight of the rest of the statue.  Thus, for 25 years, the marble lay in the yard of the cathedrals workshop with no one working on it. In 1501, the cathedral invited many artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, to come and work on the project. All of these artists declined. Finally, Michelangelo (1475-1564) took on the challenge. At 26 years old, Michelangelo had already completed his other great sculpture, the Pieta, and was making a name for himself as a great artist.  For more than two years, Michelangelo worked on David day and night, rain and shine, until it was completed. No one knows exactly how David was made. Michelangelo refused to let others see him work or see his artwork until it was completed. Michelangelos friend Giorgio Vasari claimed that Michelangelo made a small model of the sculpture, laid it on its back, and then covered it in water. Michelangelo then took away some of the water until a bit of the model appeared, and carved that bit into the marble. He continued doing this, little by little, until the sculpture was finished. This was what Vasari claimed, but this was just a guess: Michelangelo kept his methods a secret from everyone, even Vasari. Indeed, years after he carved David, Michelangelo was working on another work of art, deep into the night. Vasari tried to sneak in to see Michelangelo at work. However, as soon as Michelangelo realised that the door had been opened, he quickly blew out the candles so that the room became dark and his visitor could see nothing.  When Michelangelo finally revealed his statue to the people of Florence, everyone was amazed. They knew at once that it was the greatest work they had ever seen. Not only was it a beautiful work of art, it was different from all other statues of David ever made. Unlike other statues of David, which showed him as a little boy wearing armour, Michelangelos David was a naked young man. Other statues always showed David after the battle. Michelangelo's David is before the battle, looking ahead in confidence, with his sling across his shoulder. He shows no fear of his enemy, and he is already looking ahead to victory. - a UNIT1 ART   Many people have noted that while the statue is called David, it does not remind them of a hero in the Bible. Rather, it looks like one of those statues of Greek gods that are regarded as some of the greatest works of art ever produced. Nevertheless, anyone seeing the statue for the first time would probably agree that his David is an extraordinary masterpiece.  One fascinating thing about the statue is how imperfect it is, yet how perfect it seems. David stands with his left foot forward, and all his weight is on his right foot. Given how narrow his legs are and how much he leans to his right, one would think that the statue would break or fall over, yet it still stands more than 500 years later. Davids head and hands are also larger than they should be. In fact, his right hand is enormous. Finally, the statue is quite narrow from front to backby proportion much narrower than most people are in real life. This is due to the fact that the marble was too narrow to begin with. Yet, somehow, even when viewed from the side, the statue still works and still looks realistic. Everything looks perfect, even if it is not.  Those who first saw the statue certainly thought that it was perfect. Indeed, they thought the statue was too good to go on top of the cathedral where people would have trouble seeing it. In truth, even if they had decided to put it on top of the cathedral, given its weight, they had no way to lift it that high. Indeed, they were not sure how they could move it from the workshop yard without breaking it. Finally, after great effort and much care, they moved the statue to the main square of the city. There, it quickly became a symbol of the city of Florence. The people were all inspired by the way David looked ahead without fear of the future. However, in time, the statue became damaged by rain, snow, and wind. In order to protect the statue from further damage, in 1873 it was moved inside to the Gallery of the Academy in Florence, where today it is visited by up to three million people a year.  68  UNIT 2 ; Oe  Using Words and Expressions  1  Complete the sentences with the correct forms of the phrases in the box.  make up ones mind _ shave off  feel pessimistic in response to  take control of stress out  rely on straight away  1 When the old man his  beard, he looked more energetic. 2 His parents tried to persuade him to stay in the local city to live a life of leisure, but he had  already to workin the countryside.  3 You cannot expect to feel better  after taking the medicine.  4 He his desire for high- fat food and managed to lower his blood pressure.  5 She walks 20,000 steps a day  her friend's challenge.  6 He was because he had lost no weight after three months of dieting.  7 Heused to me to remind him to exercise regularly.  8 The team about being  able to win the championship.

MY EXPERIENCES WITH COMPUTER GAMES  | clearly remember the first time | played a computer game. | was seven years old. My friend had gotten a computer for his birthday. He invited me to play a game, which was very simple by todays standards, but we loved it! We played for hours. We would meet after school every day to play it. My addiction to computer games started then. Not long after that, my friend moved to the city. | missed him, but | got my own computer and began playing by myself.  Over the years, computer games developed rapidly. Technology improved, and there were always new and better games to play. You could then play games over the Internet with people from all over the world, using either computers or smartphones. The online games were fascinating and it was always exciting to play.  At first, | played games over the Internet after | had done my homework and eaten dinner. Then | started playing as soon as | got home each day. My parents stopped me, so | started playing it in the middle of the night. | went to school and often fell asleep in class. My teacher would scold me but | would often do the same thing the next day! Shortly after that, | began to skip meals and play through the night. My parents found out and took away my computer and smartphone. | knew | had gone too far. My love of computer games had become an addiction. It was affecting my schoolwork and my health, and | felt quite depressed.  Then one day | bumped into my friend again! He had moved back to our hometown. We hadnt seen each other for ages. He looked happy and healthy. We talked about the past and the good times we had, playing that old game. He still played computer games, but he also did many other things. He invited me to play basketball with some friends. | got tired quickly, but | loved it! Afterwards, we played a board game. We laughed and talked and played for hours. It was very sociable and great fun. Playing games with my friends in real life was much more enjoyable than doing so online.  Computer games are great fun and | still play them sometimes. New technology is making more amazing things possible.

The story follows the lives of the March family. While the father is working away from home, the mother has to look after their four teenaged daughtersMeg, Jo, Beth, and Amyon her own.  THE EXPERIMENT Louisa May Alcott  (adapted from Little Women)  Vacation, finally! exclaimed Meg, coming home to find Jo already lying on the sofa.  What will you do on your vacation? asked Amy.  Stay in bed late, and do nothing, replied Meg.  Sit in the old apple tree and read! said Jo.  Beth, lets not do any lessons for a while, but play all the time and rest, like Meg and Jo, begged Amy.  | will, if Mother doesnt mind. | want to learn some new songs, replied Beth.  May we all try what we want to do, Mother? asked Meg.  You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it, Mrs March said with a smile.  It will be wonderful, Im sure, said Meg.  Fun forever, and no work! exclaimed Jo.  The next morning, Meg got up at ten oclock and had breakfast alone. Jo spent the morning with a friend and the afternoon reading in the apple tree. Beth pulled all her toys out of her closet but then left them to play some music. Amy put on her best dress and went outside to draw, hoping someone  would notice the beautiful young artist. No one appeared, so she went for a walk, got caught in the rain, and came home dripping.  In the evening, they all assured their mother the experiment was going well. She smiled, said nothing, and did her work, keeping their home pleasant and running smoothly.  The days became longer and longer, and it affected all four girls. Meg found time hanging heavily and started cutting and spoiling her clothes, trying to make them more fashionable. Jo read till her eyes hurt and she was sick of books. Beth sometimes suddenly shook her doll and shouted at it. Amy was quite bored, for she didnt like dolls or reading, and she couldnt draw all the time. But no one would admit that they were tired of the experiment.  On Saturday morning, the girls got up to find no breakfast in the dining room and no mother to be seen.  Meg ran upstairs and soon came back, looking relieved but a little ashamed.  Mother isnt sick, only very tired. She says she is going to rest today and let us do the best we can. She says it has been a hard week for her, so we must take care of ourselves.  The girls put together a breakfast tray for their mother and Jo brought it up to her. The tea was very bitter, the eggs were burnt, and the biscuits tasted odd, but she thanked them for their kindness.  73 ~ WORKBOOK = - = SEE   ==   They will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they won't suffer, and it will do them good, she said to herself after Jo left, taking out the breakfast which she had prepared for herself earlier.  Meg went to tidy the living room, hiding the litter under the sofa and shutting the curtains to save her the trouble of dusting. :  Jo went to ask their mother about lunch. Eat whatever you like, said Mrs March. Im going out to lunch. Im taking a vacation today.  And so Jo discovered that something more than energy and effort is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the vegetables for an hour, burnt the bread, found only a small bit of meat in the lobster, and then declared lunch ready before the potatoes were quite done. The girls and their two guests sit down to lunch.  The one strong point was the strawberries, for Jo had covered them in sugar and had a jug of cream to go with them. Amy took a big spoonful and choked.  Whats wrong? exclaimed Jo.  Salt, not sugar, and the cream is sour, replied Meg.  Jo was about to cry, when suddenly she realized how funny it all was. She laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did everyone else, and the lunch ended with bread and butter and fun. They were then busy for the whole afternoon, tidying and cleaning, as well as receiving guests and running errands.  In the evening, the girls gathered on the porch. f Each girl groaned or sighed as she sat down.  What a dreadful day this has been! began Jo.  It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable, said Meg.  Not a bit like home, added Amy.  Not without Mother, sighed Beth.  Here | am, dear. Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another week of it? she asked.  | dont! cried Jo.  Nor |, echoed the others. Mother, did you go away just to see how wed get on? said Meg.  Yes, | thought you should see what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. Isnt it pleasanter to have daily duties and then relax? To help each other out, so home is comfortable for us all?  Oh yes, Mother! exclaimed the girls.  Our little burdens seem heavy but will grow lighter as we learn to carry them. Work keeps us from boredom and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion. But remember, dont go to the other extreme and work like slaves! Have regular hours for work and play and make each day both useful and pleasant. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life will become a success, whether you're rich or poor.  74 UNIT 3 :  Using Words and Expressions  1 Match the words from the two boxes to make new phrases and then use them to complete the sentences below.  autonomous corporate nuclear river safety wildlife  SSIS RISA ESD OSES SAN SD AREAS  basin conservation _ culture energy inspection region  1 Most used vehicles are required to pass  a before their sale or 3  transfer.  2 The Inner Mongolia is the widest province in China and has a diverse topography, including plateaus, hills, plains, deserts, rivers, and lakes.  3 Itis known to all that rivers have been the cradles of human civilisation since ancient times.

SMALL WASTE, BIG PROBLEM  Many of us might not give a second thought to dropping a small piece of litter. After all, if it is so small, it cannot possibly be that harmful, can it? In todays world, the answer is certainly Yes it can! With the growing use of plastic bags and the rising number of smokers, there is more litter being produced than ever before.  Although cigarette butts are small, they are bad for the environment. _ Worldwide, about 4.3 trillion cigarette butts are littered every year. As well as spoiling the beauty of the environment, they contain toxic chemicals. These find their way into the water supply where they affect water quality and endanger plants and animals. Cigarette butts can take up to 25 years to break down, and the toxic chemicals add up g toa large amount with so many littered. So, if people want to smoke, they should dispose of the butts properly in a rubbish bin.  Plastic bags are another common form of litter that is dangerous to the  environment. They are easily blown by wind and float in water, so they can travel long distances. They find their way to rivers, parks, beaches, and oceans, killing many birds, mammals, fish, and sea animals each year worldwide. They can last for hundreds of years in the environment. We should not let plastic bags become litter. We should use fewer plastic bags, and reuse and recycle what we have already used.  78  a . UNIT3 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION   One way to reduce the use of plastic bags is to charge for them. Shops used to give plastic bags for free. But in some countries, including China, customers are now charged for each bag. Some shops also have a bag-for-life scheme. They sell stronger bags that can be reused, and they replace them for free if the bags ever break.  Waste is a big problem for the environment, so we need to do something. Not littering at all or cleaning up small waste saves money spent on disposing of litter properly. However, it would be better not to smoke or use plastic bags at all.

As countries develop and their populations grow, the demand for the energy to support them increases. Until now, this growth has relied heavily on the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas). Although their use has been essential so far, reliance on them has led to pollution problems, and perhaps the greatest future challenge for mankind, climate change.  Thankfully, many countries are making the important change from fossil fuels to clean, green, and renewable sources of energy. Fossil fuels produce emissions, such as carbon dioxide, which contribute to the greenhouse effect and the global climate. They are also finite sources, which means there is a limited supply of them. Once a source has been used up, another must be found, and finding new sources becomes more difficult and expensive over time. With no emissions or waste, renewable energy sources cause limited damage to the environment. They are renewable because they can be naturally replaced and can therefore be consumed without the risk of using them up.  Here are the main types of renewable energy, with facts and examples from around the world.  Hydropower  The power of water turns turbines which produce electricity. Since ancient times, watermills have been used for many things, from grinding wheat to sawing timber. Countries such as Paraguay and Norway already produce all or most of their energy from hydropower. Most of the renewable energy in China comes from hydropower plants, such as the Three Gorges Dam, the worlds largest power station.  Solar Solar panels turn heat from the suns rays into electricity, and solar heaters use that energy to heat water directly. This is the fastest growing renewable energy source, as the cost of the technology is falling.  Germany has the highest solar capacity in the world, but China is the worlds largest market and the largest producer of solar technology.  80 i CS = UNIT3 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION     Wind  Tall turbines are turned by the wind to produce electricity. Wind farms are built on land, or offshore, to take advantage of more frequent and powerful winds at sea. The worlds largest wind farm is the London Array. It has 175 wind turbines and is 20 km off the coast of England. Researchers think China could meet all her electricity demands from wind by 2030. Wind farms in provinces such as Gansu have an endless wind supply.  Geothermal  This has been a natural source of energy for thousands of years. Today, heat from below the earths surface heats water into steam that turns turbines to generate electricity. The USA has the largest capacity, with over 80% generated in California. The Yangbajing Power Plant is the largest geothermal plant in China.  Biofuel  This is material from biological sources (such as corn or grain) or waste products that is used to produce energy. It is used in generators for electricity, or in cars and other machines. Brazil has produced and used biofuel made from sugar cane for 40 years. China is the worlds third largest producer of biofuel.  So, what are the pros and cons of renewable energy?  The strongest pro is that it is clean, producing almost no pollution. Resources are abundant and free, and cannot be used up. Projects, once set up, require less to maintain. They are ideal on a small scale; one can have solar panels on the roof, but not a coal power station in the kitchen! It is also better for energy security. Getting resources from within the country means less reliance on resources from abroad, and less risk from political or economic changes.  There are also some cons. With no wind or sun, there may be no power. Projects are built in places where resources are abundant, but often far away from the cities where power is needed. Solar projects are expensive to set up. Hydroelectric projects can cause problems with flooding when they change the natural flow of rivers. Biofuel projects use up land, which could be used for growing food.  Can renewables really be the future of energy? Our modern world has been built on fossil fuels, so it is hard to change quickly. However, the use of renewable energy is growing in China and around the world. Given the problems of climate change, there is little doubt that they will continue to grow. As extracting fossil fuels is becoming more difficult and expensive, the cost of renewable energy is falling. New battery technology, for example, solves the problem of bringing electricity from distant sources to cities. Along with our being more aware of our energy consumption and waste, a clean, green energy future is possible and necessary.  81  _- 4 ws  82  UNIT4 |  Using Words and Expressions  1  Combine the suffixes with the words to form new words.

FAN ZHONGYAN  Perhaps one of the most famous sayings in China is, To be the first to feel concern for the troubles of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures. Written by Fan Zhongyan, this 11th century proverb provides a goal for all Chinese government officials to aspire to.  Fan Zhongyan (989-1052) himself was a good example of someone who lived by these words. Fan was born in Suzhou in 989 CE. When he was just one or two years old, his father died and his mother married another man. From a very young age, he was very diligent in his schoolwork. Later, he left his stepfathers family and had to stay in a temple, where he was only able to eat porridge each day. In the winter, he had to cut frozen porridge into pieces for his meals. It is said that one day one of his friends noticed that he was not eating well, so he sent over some tasty food. Fan refused to touch it, saying that he wanted to be content with what he had.  In 1015, Fan passed the imperial examination and became a government official. While he served in Taizhou, he always had the peoples best interest at heart, and so he proposed building a sea wall to protect homes from flooding. This sea wall was later called Lord Fans Embankment. Serving with distinction, he helped build up defenses when the country was threatened by war. Then, once the country was at peace again, he was promoted to a high- level position in the capital, where he was able to advise the emperor on government policy.  As an advisor to the emperor, Fan then tried to institute government reforms, known as the Qingli reforms. However, many conservative bureaucrats opposed him, and so the reforms were stopped and Fan was forced to leave the capital and go into exile.  While in exile in 1045, Fan wrote an essay entitled Memorial to Yueyang Tower. In the essay, he wondered if it was possible to find government officials who would be firm in their desire to look after the needs of the common people, and not worry about their own personal welfare. Of such a man, Fan said, When serving in a high office at court, he will be concerned for the people; if living on distant rivers and lakes, he will be concerned for his sovereign. When serving, he worries; while in retirement, he worries. And when does he enjoy himself? One must say: To be the first to feel concern for the troubles of the world, and the last to enjoy its pleasures.  SkeER ees eae  ae es MR & te  a  ee hae ity aaa OR  : EB ae Rae et  85    WORKBOOK =    - er oe =  After Fan retired, he bought a farm and used it to provide jobs for local people. The profits from the farm were then used to pay for the education of poor children. Though by this time he was a wealthy man, he spent all of his money helping others and lived a very simple life.  It is refreshing to think that there was once such a person who did not just speak wise words to live by, but who also put those words into practice during his own life. Fan Zhongyan was just such a man.  2 Put the events in the correct order.  Fan retired and bought a farm. Fan wrote the essay Memorial to Yueyang Tower. Fan was demoted. Fan passed the imperial examination. 1 Fans father died. Fan built a sea wall in Taizhou. Fan helped build up the countrys defenses. Fan was only able to eat one serving of porridge a day. Fan tried to institute government reforms.  Fan became a government official.  3 Read the passage again and answer the questions below.  What do people expect an honest government official to live by? Why did many bureaucrats oppose Fans reforms?  What did he express in his famous essay?  How did Fan use his farm to help others?  In the opinion of the author, what was refreshing about Fans life?  ODN   4 ingroups, discuss the following questions.  1 How was Fan a good example of the saying? 2 In what ways can you put Fans saying into practice?  5 Have you ever met or heard of someone who persevered and overcame adversity in his/her life?

THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA (adapted)  Blood attracted the shark from deep down in the sea. Suddenly, he was on top of the blue water, shining in the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and started swimming in the direction of the skiff and the fish.  Ernest Hemingway  Sometimes he lost the scent of the fish. But when he picked it up again, he swam hard in that direction. He was a big Mako shark who swam as fast as the fastest fish in the sea, and everything about him was beautiful, except his jaws. His back was blue like a sword fish, his belly was silver, and his thick skin was smooth and handsome. He looked like a sword fish except for his huge jaws. Just under the surface you could see his fin moving quickly through the water. Inside his jaws all of his teeth were shaped like claws. They were long and sharp on both sides. The shark is so fast and strong that he is king of the sea. Now he smelled a fresh scent and swam quickly through the water.  When the old man saw him coming, he knew that this shark was not afraid. He prepared the harpoon and some rope as the shark approached. The rope was short as he had cut some away before to tie the fish.  The old mans head was clear now and he was ready, but he was not hopeful. | cant win, he thought. He watched the great fish come closer. This might be a dream, he thought. | cannot keep him from hitting me but maybe | can get him.  The old man saw the sharks mouth open and take a bite of the fish just above its tail. The sharks head and back came out of the water and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping when he pushed the harpoon down onto the sharks head between his eyes. That was the location of the brain and the old man hit it using all his strength. Despite > this, he worried that this was not over yet and that things might still get worse.  =s The shark turned over again and again,  wrapping himself in the rope. The old * man knew that he was dead but the shark would not accept it. Then, on his  back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the shark plowed over the  87  WORKBOOK  water. Three-quarters of his body was clear above the water when the rope broke. The shark lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him. Then he went down very slowly.  He took about forty pounds, the old man said aloud. He took my harpoon too and all the rope, he thought. And now my fish bleeds again and there will be other sharks soon.  He did not want to look at the damaged fish anymore. When the fish had been hit, it felt like he was hit.  But | killed the shark that hit my fish, he thought.

NQOohond   What are the typical features of classical Chinese poetry?  How is modern poetry written?  What themes did the three Tang Dynasty poets like to write about? Who first introduced Americans to Chinese poetry?  When did European literature come to China?  Who are the most popular English Romantic poets?  What does the writer think about translations of poems?  EXPLORING POETRY IN CHINA  Poetry plays with sounds, words, and grammar. That makes poetry difficult to write but very interesting to read. Poetry uses colours, feelings, experiences, and images to paint a picture  in your mind.  In Chinese classical poetry, the form is very important: the correct number of lines and the number of characters in each line. Poetry often follows special patterns of rhythm and rhyme. However, modern poets began to reject traditional forms and structures for poetry in the 20th century. As a result, most poetry today is written in free verse, with lines of varying length.  92  During the Tang Dynasty, a high point of classical Chinese poetry, poems by Li Bai, Du Fu, and Wang Wei became very popular. Widely known as a genius and often called the Immortal Poet, Li Bai (701-762) wrote with a romantic style and his poems celebrated things such as friendship, nature, and wine. Du Fu (712-770) is also known as one of the greatest Chinese poets. He has been called the Poet-Historian and the Poet- Sage by Chinese critics, and his poems cover a range of topics, with his most famous poems reflecting on the effects of war on the people. Wang Wei (701-761) was a painter, musician, and poet, and he was well known for his love of nature in his paintings and poetry.    - UNITS POEMS   Outside of Asia, the study of Chinese language introduced the West to Chinese poetry Americans were first introduced to classical Chinese poetry by American poet Ezra Pound (1885-1973). He translated 18 classical Chinese poems, mainly by Li Bai, into English, based on the notes of the American art historian Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908). At about the same time, Chinese writers started reading more foreign poetry. From around 1910 onwards, European literature came to China when some famous writers began to translate both poetry and novels into Chinese.  Just like readers in the West, Chinese readers admire Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope and many others for their fine English poetry. English Romantic poets are greatly loved in China. The nature poems by William Wordsworth, Ode to the West Wind by Percy Bysshe Shelley, George Gordon Byron's Isles of Greece, and long poems by John Keats have long been favourites. The style and the atmosphere in their poems have often led to comparisons with poets such as Du Fu and Li Bai. Among modern poetry, the American poet Robert Frost and his poems might be the best known.  Today, many Chinese people are becoming more interested in reading poems, no matter in what language they are written. Translations can be good, but being able to read in the original language is best. No matter how well a poem is translated, something of the spirit of the original work is lost. Besides, poems and literature can be bridges between East and West. They can help us to understand each other better, or as the poet Mu Dan wrote:  Quietly, we embrace In a world lit up by words.  2 Discuss the questions with your partner.  1 How has foreign poetry influenced Chinese poetry?

SPRING MORNING (translated by Xu Yuanchong) Meng Haoran  This spring morning in bed Im lying, Not to awake till birds are crying. After one night of wind and showers, How many are the fallen flowers?  (translated by Xu Yuanchong) : THE ROAD NOT TAKEN  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood And both that morning equally lay And sorry I could not travel both In leaves no step had trodden black. And be one traveler, long I stood Oh, I kept the first for another day! And looked down one as far as I could Yet knowing how way leads on to way, To where it bent in the undergrowth; I doubted if I should ever come back. Then took the other, as just as fair, I shall be telling this with a sigh And having perhaps the better claim, Somewhere ages and ages hence: Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Two roads diverged in a wood, and I~ Though as for that the passing there I took the one less traveled by, Had worn them really about the same, And that has made all the difference.  Sy st  Robert Frost Ee  = av UNITS POEMS  THE GIFT  1 want to give you a ei my child, for we are drifiing i in the stream of the world.  Our lives will be carried apart, and our love forgotten.  But ] am not so foolish as to hope that 1 could buy your heart with my gifts.  Young is your life, your path long, and you drink the love we bring you at one draught and turn and run away fromus.  You have your play and your playmates. What harm is there if you have no time for thought for us?  We indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days that are past, to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost for ever.  The river runs swift with a song, breaking through all barriers. But the mountain stays and remembers, and follows her with his love.  Tagore ON CHILDREN  Your children are not your children.  They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you,  And though they are with you yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts,  For they have their own thoughts.  You may house their bodies but not their souls,  For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,  which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.  You may strive to be like them,  but seek not to make them like you.  For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.  You are the bows from which your children  as living arrows are sent forth.  The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might  that His arrows may go swift and far.  Let your bending in the archers hand be for gladness;  For even as He loves the arrow that flies,  so He loves also the bow that is stable.
