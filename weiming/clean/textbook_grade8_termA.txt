What Do No. 5 High School Students Do in Their Free Time?  Last month we asked our students about their free time activities. Our questions were  about exercise, use of the Internet and watching TV. Here are the results.  We found that only fifteen percent of our students exercise every day. Forty-five percent exercise four to six times a week. Twenty percent exercise only one to three  times a week. And twenty percent do not exercise at all!  We all know that many students often go online, but we were surprised that ninety percent of them use the Internet every day. The other ten percent use it at least three  or four times a week. Most students use it for fun and not for homework.  The answers to our questions about watching television were also interesting. Only two percent of the students watch TV one to three times a week. Thirteen percent watch TV four to six times a week. And eighty-five percent watch TV every day! Although many students like to watch sports, game shows are the most popular.  It is good to relax by using the Internet or watching game shows, but we think the best way to relax is through exercise. It is healthy for the mind and the body. Exercise such as playing sports is fun, and you can spend time with your friends and family as you play together. And remember, Old habits die hard. So start exercising before its too late!

Today there are already robots working in factories. Some can help to build cars, and they do simple jobs over and over again. Fewer people will do such jobs in the future because they are boring, but robots will never get bored.  Scientists are now trying to make robots look like humans and do the same things as we do. Some robots in Japan can walk and dance. They are fun to watch. However, some scientists believe that although we can make robots move like people, it will be difficult to make them really think like a human. For example, scientist James White thinks that robots will never be able to wake up and know where they are. But many scientists disagree with Mr. White. They think that robots will even be able to talk like humans in 25 to S0 years.  Some scientists believe that there will be more robots in the future. However, they agree it may take hundreds of years. These new robots will have many different shapes. Some will look like humans, and others might look like animals. In India, for example, scientists made robots that look like snakes. If buildings fall down with people inside, these snake robots can help look for people under the buildings.

If people have problems, they should get advice from an expert. c. If people have problems, they should keep them to themselves.  b. If people have problems, they should talk to other people.  | Students these days often have alot of worries. |  Sometimes they have problems with their | schoolwork, and sometimes with their friends. What can they do about this? Some people believe the worst thing is to  do nothing. Laura Mills, a teenager from = -  London, agrees. Problems and worries are normal in life, says Laura. But I think talking to someone helps a lot. Unless we talk to someone, we'll  certainly feel worse.  Laura once lost her wallet, and worried for days. She was afraid to tell her parents about it. She even walked three miles to school each day because she | didnt have any money. She just kept thinking, If] tell my parents, they'll be angry! In the end, she talked to her parents and they were really understanding. Her dad said he sometimes made careless mistakes himself. They got her a new wallet and asked her to be more careful. I will always remember to share  my problems in the future! Laura says.  Robert Hunt advises students about common problems. He feels the same way as Laura. It is best not to run away from our problems. We should always try to solve them. He thinks the first step is to find someone you trust to talk to. This person doesn't need to be an expert like himself. Students often forget that their parents have more experience, and are always there to help them. In English, we say that sharing a problem is like cutting it in half.
