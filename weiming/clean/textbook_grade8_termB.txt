As a mountain climber, Aron is used to taking risks. This is one of the exciting things about doing dangerous sports. There were many times wits Aron almost lost his life because of accidents. On April 26, 2003, he found himself in a very dangerous situation when climbing in Utah.  On that day, Arons arm was caught under a 360-kilo rock that fell on him when he was climbing by himself in the mountains. Because he could not free his arm,  he stayed there for five days and hoped that someone would find him. But when his water ran out, he knew that he would have to do something to save his own life. He was not ready to die that day. So he used his knife to cut off half his right arm. Then, with his left arm, he bandaged himself so that he would not lose too much blood. After that, he climbed down the mountain to find help.  After losing his arm, he wrote a book called Between a Rock and a Hard Place. This means being in a difficult situation that you cannot seem to get out of. In this book, Aron tells of the importance of making good decisions, and of being in control of one life. His love for mountain climbing is so great that he kept on climbing mountains even after this experience.  Do we have the same spirit as Aron?

Understanding Parts of Speech |  Knowing what part of speech a word is (noun, verb, preposition, | Dear Miss Li, etc.) can help you understand the word's meaning.  I'd like to thank you for giving money to Animal Helpers. Im sure you know that this group was set up to help disabled people like me. You helped to make it possible for me to have Lucky. Lucky makes a big difference to my life. Let me tell you my story.  What would it be like to be blind or deaf? Or imagine you cant walk or use your hands easily. Most people would never think about this, but many people have these difficulties. I cant use my arms or legs well, so normal things like answering the telephone, opening and closing doors, or carrying things are difficult for me. Then one day last year, a friend of mine helped me out. She talked to Animal Helpers about getting me a special trained dog. She also thought a dog might cheer me up. I love animals and I was excited about the idea of having a dog.  After six months of training with a dog at Animal Helpers, I was able to bring him home. My dogs name is Lucky  a good name for him because I feel very lucky to have him. You see, Im only able to have a dog helper because of your kindness! Lucky is very clever and understands many English words. He can understand me when I give him orders. For example, I say, Lucky! Get my book, and he does it at once.  Lucky is a fantastic dog. Ill send you a photo of him if you like, and I could show you how he helps me. Thank you again for changing my life.

It is the parents job to provide a clean and comfortable environment at home for their children. And anyway, I think doing chores is not so difficult. I do not mind doing them.  Ms. Miller  Dear Sir,  I think it is important for children to learn how to do chores and help their parents with housework. It is not enough to just get good grades at school. Children these days depend on their parents too much. They are always asking, Could you get this for me? or Could you help me with that? Doing chores helps to develop childrens independence and teaches them how to look after themselves. It also helps them to understand the idea of fairness. Since they live in one house with their parents, they should know that everyone should do their part in keeping it clean and tidy. Our neighbors son got into a good college but during his first year, he had no idea how to take care of himself. As a result, he often fell ill and his grades dropped. The earlier kids learn to be independent, the better it is for their future.

Its the only communication they have. I dont know if I should say anything to them about this. When they argue, its like a big, black cloud hanging over our home. Also, my elder brother is not very nice to me. He always refuses to let me watch my favorite TV show. Instead he watches whatever he wants until late at night. I dont think this is fair. At home I always feel lonely and nervous. Is that normal? What can I do?  Sad and Thirteen  Dear Sad and Thirteen, Its not easy being your age, and its normal to have these feelings. Why dont you talk about these feelings with your family? If your parents are having problems, you should offer to help. Maybe you could do more jobs around the house so that they have more time for proper communication. Secondly, why dont you sit down and communicate with your brother? You should explain that you dont mind him watching TV all the time. However, he should let you watch your favorite show. I hope things will be better for you soon.

Life for Cathy Taylor's three children is very busy. On most days after school, Cathy says, I take one of my two boys to basketball practice and my daughter to football training. Then I have to take my other son to piano lessons. Maybe I could cut out a few of their activities, but I believe these activities are important for my childrens future. I really want them to be successful. However, the tired children dont get home until after 7:00 p.m. They have a quick dinner, and then its time for homework.  Linda Miller, a mother of three, knows all about such stress. In some families, competition starts very young and continues until the kids get older, she says. Mothers send their small kids to all kinds of classes. And they are always comparing them with other children. Its crazy. I dont think thats fair. Why dont they just let their kids be kids? People shouldn't push their kids so hard.  Doctors say too much pressure is not good for a childs development. Dr. Alice Green says all these activities can cause a lot of stress for children. Kids should have time to relax and think for themselves, too.

Of all the mountains, Qomolangma rises the highest and is the most famous. It is 8,844.43 meters high and so is very dangerous to climb. Thick clouds cover the top and snow can fall very hard. Even more serious difficulties include freezing weather conditions and heavy storms. It is also very hard to take in air as you get near the top.

In fact, many people around the world love these black and white animals. Pandas have become so popular that they are now a symbol of China.  Scientists say there are now fewer than 2,000 pandas living in the forests. Another 300 or so live in zoos or research centers in China and other countries. Pandas do not have many babies, maybe only one every two years. The babies often die from illnesses and do not live very long. Adult pandas spend more than 12 hours a day eating about 10 kilos of bamboo. Many years ago, there were a lot more bamboo forests and pandas in China, but then humans started to cut down these forests. As the forests get smaller and other human activities cause more problems, pandas cannot find enough to eat and they are having fewer babies.  An education program in Chengdu teaches children about pandas and other endangered wild animals. They send people to schools to tell children about the importance of saving these animals.

I go out with my gun almost every day to kill animals and birds for food. I'm even learning to grow fruit and vegetables.  A few weeks ago, I found the marks of another man's feet on the sand. Who else is on my island? How long have they been here? Not long after that, I saw some cannibals trying to kill two men from a broken ship. One of them died but the other ran towards my house.

But  five years ago, while she was studying abroad in England, she heard a song full of feelings about returning home on the radio. It made Sarah think about her family and friends back in the US. She came to realize how much she actually missed all of them. Ever since then, she has been a fan of American country music.  Country is a traditional kind of music from the southern states of America. Nashville, Tennessee is the home of country music. Many songs these days are just about modern life in the US, such as the importance of money and success, but not about belonging to a group. However, country music brings us back to the good old days when people were kind to each other and trusted one another. It reminds us that the best things in life are free  laughter, friends, family, and the beauty of nature and the countryside.  Sarah hasn't been to Nashville yet, but it is her dream to go there one day. She has already read a lot about the place and done some research on it. She knows that there is a Country Music Hall of Fame Museum in Nashville. There are also always a lot of great country music concerts with famous musicians and singers, like Garth Brooks. Sarah has already listened to most of his songs. Garth is one of the most successful musicians in American history. Hes sold more than 120 million records.

On the one hand, more than three quarters of the population are Chinese, so you can simply speak Putonghua a lot of the time. On the other hand, Singapore is an English-speaking country, so its also a good  place to practice your English!  Have you ever tried Chinese food outside of China? Maybe you fear that you won't be able to find anything good to eat when you travel. In Singapore, however, you'll find a lot of food from China; you won't have any problem getting rice, noodles or dumplings. Singapore is also an excellent place to  try new food. Whether you like Indian food, Western food or Japanese food, you'll find it all in Singapore!  Most large cities have zoos, but have you ever been to a zoo at night? Singapore has a Night Safari. It might seem strange to go to a zoo when its dark. However, if you go to see lions, tigers or foxes during the daytime, theyll probably be asleep! A lot of animals only wake up at night, so this is the best time to watch them. At the Night Safari, you can watch these animals in a  more natural environment than in a normal zoo.  One great thing about Singapore is that the temperature is almost the same all year round. This is because the island is so close to the equator. So you can choose to go whenever you like  spring, summer, autumn or winter.  And, of course, its not too far from China!  *Have you ever been to a museum? UNIT 9   ze The statements below are false.

Among these is Zhong Wei, a 46-year- old husband and father. He has lived in Wenzhou for the last 13 years. With a hard job in a crayon factory, he doesnt find much time to visit his hometown. I used to return home at least once a year, but I haven't been back for almost three years now. Its a shame, but I just don't have the time, he says.  Many people like Zhong Wei regard with great interest how their hometowns have changed. Perhaps large hospitals and new roads have appeared. In many places, the government has also built new schools and sent teachers from the cities to help.  I noticed thats true of my hometown, adds Zhong Wei. Children have learned to read and count at my old primary school since the mid-20th century. But now the buildings are really old. I hear theyre going to build a new school there. Zhong Wei thinks such developments are good, and he also knows that his hometown cannot always stay  the same.  According to Zhong Wei, however, some things  will never change. In my hometown, there was a big old tree opposite the school. It is still there and has become quite a symbol of the place.

Wang Ming: Yes, thats what his wife said, too.  Anna: And where would they put all the earth and stone from the mountains?  Wang Ming: Yu Gong said they could put it into the sea because it's big enough to hold everything. So they all started digging the next day.  Section A, 2a, 2b  Wang Ming: Let me tell you the rest of the  story about Yu Gong. Yu Gong and his family began to move some of the earth and stone to the sea. One day, a man saw Yu Gong and his children when they were working on moving the mountains. He told Yu Gong that he could never do it because he was old and weak. As soon  as the man finished talking, Yu Gong said that his family could  continue to move the mountains  5102)  after he died. His family would live and grow, but the mountains could not get bigger. So Yu Gong and his family kept on digging day after day and year after year. Finally, a god was so moved by Yu Gong that he sent two gods to take the mountains away.
