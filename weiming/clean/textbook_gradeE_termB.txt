JOHN SNOW DEFEATS KING CHOLERA  Cholera used to be one of the most feared diseases in the world, until a British doctor, John Snow, showed how it could be overcome. This illness causes severe diarrhoea, dehydration, and even death. In the early 19th century, when an outbreak of cholera hit Europe, millions of people died from the disease. As a young doctor, John Snow became frustrated because no one knew how to prevent or treat cholera. In time, he rose to  become a famous doctor, and even attended to Queen Victoria when she gave birth. However, he never lost his desire to destroy cholera once and for all.  In general, doctors in those days had two contradictory theories to explain how cholera spread. One theory was that bad air caused the disease. Another was that cholera was caused by an infection from germs in food or water. Snow subscribed to the second theory. It was correct, but he still needed proof. Consequently, when an outbreak of cholera hit London in 1854, Snow began to investigate. He discovered that in two particular streets the cholera outbreak was so severe that more than 500 people died in ten days. He was determined to find out why.  Snow began by marking on a map the exact places where all those who died had lived. There were multiple deaths near the water pump in Broad Street (especially house numbers 16, 37, 38, and 40). However, some households (such as 20 and 21 Broad Street, and 8 and 9 Cambridge Street) had had no deaths. These people worked in the pub at 7 Cambridge Street. They had been given free beer, and so had not drunk the water from the pump. Snow suspected that  Part of Snow's Cholera Map the water pump was to blame. What is more, Note:  : 1 death PH: public house 30, 31, ...: numbers of houses  in another part of London, a woman and her daughter had died of cholera after moving away from Broad Street. It seemed that the woman liked the water from the pump so much that she had it delivered to her house every day. As a result of this evidence, John Snow was able to announce that the pump water carried cholera germs. Accordingly, he had the handle of the pump removed so that it could not be used. Through this intervention, the disease was stopped in its tracks.  2 UNIT 1 SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS The truth was that the water from the Broad Street pump had been infected by waste. Moreover, Snow was later able to show a link between other cases of cholera and the different water companies in London. Some companies sold water from the River Thames that was polluted by raw waste. The people who drank this water were much more likely to get cholera than those who drank pure or boiled water.  Through Snow's tireless efforts, water companies began to sell clean water, and the threat of cholera around the world saw a substantial decrease. However, cholera is still a problem. Each year, millions of people around the world get cholera and many die from it. Fortunately, we now know how to prevent cholera, thanks to the work of John Snow. Moreover, in his use of maps and statistics, Snow transformed the way scientists study diseases. For this reason, Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology.  3 Read the passage again and complete the chart below.

Targeting the host rather than the was a bit non-traditional but made sense because it was tricky to target the virus. Cold-causing virus are not only of  kinds, they also rapidly, meaning they can quickly develop resistance to medicine. Researchers are working on making a form of medicine that can be taken directly into ones lungs, to the chance of side effects. Though these scientists have made advances in their research, further is needed to make sure such drugs are not so that they harm the body.  4 UNIT 1 SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS Discover useful structures  1  Underline all the examples in the reading passage where noun clauses are used as the predicative.

THE FATHER OF CHINAS AEROSPACE  Perhaps no other scientist has had a greater impact on Chinas aerospace science than Qian Xuesen. Described by the authors of the Story of Qian Xuesen as a man with great scientific thought and scientific spirit who was patriotic and served his homeland with effort, achievement, and devotion, Qian was an extremely well-respected man.  Born in Hangzhou in 1911, Qian attended schools in Beijing and then entered Shanghai Jiao Tong University to study Railway Mechanical Engineering. However, after the Songhu Battle  broke out in 1932, Qian made the decision to switch his major to aviation because he realised that China needed its own powerful air force to protect and defend the country.  Qian went to the United States in 1935 to pursue his graduate studies. Over the course of the 1930s and 1940s, Qian became a pioneer in American jet and rocket technology. As a graduate assistant at the California Institute of Technology during the 1930s, Qian helped conduct important research into rocket propulsion,  UNIT 1 SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS  7 Using Language  8              and in the 1940s, he and several other people founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, now one of NASAs leading space-exploration centres.  After overcoming some difficulties during his final few years in the US, Qian returned to China in 1955. He received a heros welcome from his homeland and was put in charge of not only developing Chinas rocket science but also its space and missile programme. At that time, China was poor and its rocket science was undeveloped. No institute or university in China offered rocket science as a major, and there were no talents or experts in this field in China. Nevertheless, Qian  did not let that discourage him from taking on the challenge. When asked Can we Chinese possibly make missiles?, his reply was a determined Why not? We Chinese are able to make the same things that other people make.  Under Qians leadership, China developed the Dongfeng missiles, followed by the first generation of Long March rockets. In 1970, China successfully launched its first man-made satellite, Dong Fang Hong I, from a Long March rocket. Because much of the technology behind the Shenzhou rockets can also be traced back to Qians research, Qian earned the name of the father of Chinas aerospace.  Qian read a lot and was extremely knowledgeable, especially in the area of frontier science research. However, what might have made him such an outstanding and creative scientist was probably his strong interest in other things, such as music and drawing. His deep appreciation for art often gave him inspiration in his scientific research.  On 31 October 2009, the whole country was saddened by Qians death, and people honoured and remembered him in different ways.  A WORLD OF PURE THOUGHT  Stephen Hawking was one of the most famous and gifted scientists in physics. Most people are familiar with images of him in his wheelchair, unable to move and using a computer to talk. Since he came down with a disease which caused him to lose the use of most of his muscles, his world became one of abstract thought.  Hawking first achieved fame when he was still healthy enough to walk, as a graduate student in physics at Cambridge University in 1964. In general, there were two main theories on the origin of the universe. The first was the steady state theory, which holds that the universe has no beginning or end. The other was the big bang theory, which holds that the universe began at a single point in time and space. The biggest champion of the steady state concept was Fred  UNIT 1 SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS  Hoyle, a professor at Cambridge. During the question and answer period after one of Hoyles lectures, Hawking stood up and pointed out that Hoyle had made a mistake in his maths. Once the maths was corrected, it showed that the big bang theoryand not the steady state theory was true. Hawkings own work on the big bang theory was soon proven by astronomers with telescopes. A star was born.  say, and to dream of what others were afraid to dream about. Furthermore, he was quite determined. This had helped him as a scientist, and had helped him even more in his fight against his disease. Above all, Hawking was willing  to admit his faults. This odd combination of characteristics had made him one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th and 21st centuries.  So, what made Stephen Hawking a genius? Besides being brilliant, he was brave, though sometimes careless in what he said or did. He was willing to say what others were afraid to  1 Qian changed his major because of a shift in personal interest. T F 2 Qians strong interest in art has a positive impact on a scientist's development. 7 F 3 When Hawking was young, almost everyone believed that the universe  began with a big bang.

But few scientists have placed themselves under the . So even though the scientific method, which mainly includes hypotheses, data collection, and statistical analysis, is written down, the method by which scientists come to conclusions is hard to identify. Two of the essential qualities a scientist needs to have seem to be curiosity and creativity. People who are curious usually have a mixture of seemingly desires: They are looking for originality and yet they also want everything in its proper place. To settle the conflict between statistics and  , scientists often have to be creative, and think outside the boxapproach the problem from different directions. They must have a vivid imagination and a strong intuition in order for new  to be made. It echoes something the___S Carl Sagan once said. He believes that every child starts out as a scientist and every child is with the sense of wonder and awe.  2 Fillin each blank with a word or expression that introduces a predicative clause.  Science is simply you can do. And doing science makes you a scientist! So, what do scientists do? Actually, what matters is not only they observe in the world around them and what questions they ask, but also they use evidence or data to answer the questions. They identify useful data and take new measurements. Some of the key issues that scientists face are calculations they do and  they analyse their data to draw conclusions about the questions they ask. The final issue, which many believe to be the most important, is they need to communicate their results. This is they want everyone to benefit from their work! It seems science is all around us. You see, by doing science, scientists get a better understanding of the world around them and share that understanding with the whole world.  ?

Another challenge for Xie Lei is the academic requirements. The first time that she had to write an essay, her tutor explained that she must acknowledge what other people had said if she cited their ideas, but that he mainly wanted to know what she thought! Xie Lei was confused because she thought she knew less than other people. Her tutor advised her to read lots of information in order to form a wise opinion of her own.  Xie Lei also found many courses included students participation in class as part of the final result. Students need to generate ideas, offer examples, apply concepts, and raise questions, as well as give presentations. At first. Xie Lei had no idea what she should say, but what surprised her was that she found herself speaking up in class after just a few weeks. My presentation on traditional Chinese art was a great success,  which boosted my confidence, she said. I'll use these skills back home for presentations. Theyll help me build a strong business in the future.  Now halfway through her exchange year, Xie Lei  feels much more at home in the UK. What seemed strange before now appears quite normal to her. Engaging in British culture has helped, she said. As well as studying hard, Ive been involved in social activities. British people are fascinated by our culture and eager to learn more about it, so |m keen to share my culture with them.

UNIT 2 BRIDGING CULTURES  19 Using Language  Express your opinions on studying abroad  @) 1  20  A local newspaper has invited parents to share their opinions about studying  abroad. Read these two letters and underline each writers main points. Then  mark the reasons for their opinions.  STUDYING ABROAD: 1S IT A GOOD OR A BAD IDEA?  Dear Editor,  In the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people studying abroad. Although studying abroad can bring great benefits, I think the disadvantages for young people are greater.  To begin with, many students who study abroad face great economic pressure. That means studying abroad is just not possible for everyone. Tuition fees and living expenses are much more expensive than at home and could end up costing most families an arm and a leg. Studying in China is much more convenient and can help save money.  Another important factor to consider is the tremendous pressure that comes with studying abroad. Students must learn how to live in an unfamiliar environment with limited language skills. Some may struggle and suffer from culture shock when learning how to behave in new surroundings. Other students are not mature enough to handle the challenges by themselves and may become depressed. Some students might even encounter problems with personal safety. In addition, different approaches to teaching and learning may come as a shock to many students.  A final point to consider is that while studying abroad does have potential benefits, young people who study in China also have a great future to look forward to! As China has boomed, the educational environment has improved significantly, with many great universities now available. They have great facilities and outstanding professors, helping to educate young people who will contribute to the economy and further strengthen our country.  To sum up, one cannot deny the fact that studying abroad has its disadvantages, so when you think about studying abroad, you should consider these many factors.  Kind regards, Wang Li (mother of twin girls)  UNIT 2 BRIDGING CULTURES  Dear Editor,  Is studying abroad a good idea or not? There are certainly disadvantages, but in my opinion, the advantages are much greater. As I always tell my son, there are no great difficulties for a person who is brave, optimistic, and willing to work hard!  The first advantage of studying abroad is personal growth. The education you gain and the experiences you have will change you for the better. For example, you will certainly become more independent because you will have to deal with all kinds of difficulties by yourself. Studying abroad also helps you to gain a global perspective and improve your general competence.  Another advantage is the increased chance for cultural exchange. Chinese students can be seen as cultural envoys promoting friendship between nations. International students in China also bring their colourful cultures here. Cooperating with people from diverse cultural backgrounds helps us view the world from different angles and thus gives us more insight into our own culture.  Finally, studying abroad provides a great opportunity to contribute to the development of our motherland. Chinas global outlook, with projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative, has helped us make connections across the world. Therefore, China needs more talented young people with a global perspective who are highly competent with languages, have leadership and organisational skills, and have strong cultural awareness. Students who study abroad will develop such skills and abilities, and these in turn will provide them with better career opportunities.  All in all, studying abroad helps to build character and increase peoples understanding of cultural diversity while strengthening China and building a shared future. for all. I think this life-changing experience is certainly worthwhile, and I hope my child will study abroad in the future.

DP :  Reading and Thinking  Understand the link between food and culture  1 Before you read, discuss these questions in groups.  1 How many kinds of Chinese cuisine are there, and how can these cuisines be described? 2 What, if anything, do these cuisines tell you about the people who eat them?  @) 2 The first paragraph has a quote: You are what you eat. In pairs, discuss what  you think this saying means. Then read the article to see if you share the same ideas as the author.  CULTURE AND CUISINE  The French author Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote, Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are. Put more simply, this means You are what you eat. Most people today relate this saying to healthy eating. However, Brillat-Savarin was actually referring to our personality, character, and culture.  Certainly, in many ways this seems to be true. Chinese cuisine is a case in point. Prior to coming to China, my only experience with Chinese cooking was in America, with Chinese food that had been changed to suit American tastes. For example, Americas most popular Chinese dish is General Tsos chicken, which consists of fried chicken covered in a sweet sauce, flavoured with hot red peppers. This is probably not an authentic Chinese recipe, however, so it cannot tell us much about the Chinese. On the other hand, it does tell us a lot about Americans. It tells us, for example, that Americans love bold, simple flavours. And, since the dish was also invented recently, it tells us that Americans are not afraid to try new foods.  Later, I had a chance to experience authentic Chinese food by coming to China. When my family and I had just arrived in China, we went looking for a good place to eat in Beijing. A Sichuan restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend, and finally, we found it. Tired, hungry, and not knowing a word of Chinese, we had no idea how to order, so the chef just began filling our table with the best food we had ever eaten. With this, we had the pleasure of experiencing an entirely new taste: Sichuan peppercorns. The food was wonderful and different, but what was even more important was the friendship offered us.  We soon moved to Shandong Province in the eastern part of North China. My favourite dish there was boiled dumplings served with vinegar. I observed that family is important to the people there. It has become a favourite traditional dish of the people in North China, where making dumplings has always been a family affair with everyonefrom the youngest to the oldestjoining in to help. Later, I learnt that the most famous food in Shandong is pancake rolls stuffed with sliced Chinese green onions.  Then we moved to northern Xinjiang. Some of our friends were Kazak and Inner Mongolian. These groups traditionally wandered the open range on horses. os a result, thers traditional foods are what you  Our travels then took us to South China, and then on to central China. In each place we went, we experienced wonderful local dishes, from Guangdongs elegant dim sumsmall servings of food in bamboo steamersto the exceptional stewed noodles in Henan. Everywhere, the food was as varied as the people. However, one thing is always true: Through food, Chinese people everywhere show friendship and kindness.  At a minimum, the kinds of food local people consume tell us what they grow in their region, what kinds of lives they lead, and what they like and do not like. Could we also say, for example, that those who like bold flavours are bold themselves? Or, that those who like spicy food tend to have a hot temper? Maybe. Maybe not. What we can say, however, is that culture and cuisine go hand in hand, and if you do not experience one, you can never really know the other.  3 Use the information from the text to complete the table below.

HEOLeHyY Eetrine  There is much debate nowadays as to what makes up a healthy diet. For example, scientists have insisted for years that a big enemy of health is fatty food. However, there is increasing evidence that the real driver of poor health is not so much fatty food, as it is sugar. Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans. And in America, people who receive 25% of their daily calories or more through sugar are twice as likely to die from heart disease than people who receive less than 10% a day (Journal of the American Medical Association, 2014). This is true regardless of how healthy the rest of their diet might be. Put more simply, while people continue to argue over whether or not fatty food is dangerous, we already know that sugar is a killer.  Much of this extra sugar comes from sweets and sweet drinks. The average American gets 1/3 of his or her sugar through sweet drinks alone. The American Heart Association recommends that we limit ourselves to less than 100-150 calories a day from sugar, which is less than what is usually contained in one can of sweet drink or in a single candy bar. In other words, if you want to be healthy, you have to cut down on desserts, and cut out sweet drinks altogether.  Beyond this, you can keep healthy by consuming different categories of fresh foods, especially fruit and vegetables, which are full of vitamins and fibre, rather than processed foods. Processed foods often contain less nutrition, and have higher quantities of sugar, salt, and fat than fresh | ingredients. Besides this, it is also important to have some meat, beans, or dairy products in | your diet, as they provide the necessary protein for strong bones and muscle growth. As with everything in life, moderation is key. The ideal diet is a balanced one, without too much or too little of any one thing.  Finally, a fundamental key to healthy eating is to eat slowly. It takes about twenty minutes from the time you start eating for your brain to tell your body that you are full. What this means is that people who chew too quickly end up eating too much food because they still feel hungry. Eating slowly also allows your body to digest your food better, and will allow you to enjoy your food more. In addition, studies show that consistent eating habits, for example, taking three meals a day at the same time each day, are better for our health. It is also better to eat a modest amount of food each time, rather than to eat a lot in one meal, and then a little in the next.  There is no one trick to healthy eating. Rather, healthy eating starts with having a healthy attitude towards food. One question you can ask yourself is, Do I eat to live, or live to eat? If you are using food mostly for nutrition, then you are on the right track with your diet. However, if food has become the centre of your life, you might be on the road to bad health. It is up to you to decide how you want to live, and to make the right decisions about your diet.

Li Daiyu and her cousin Liu Qian went to Canada to visit their cousins in Halifax on the Atlantic coast. Rather than travel by commercial airline all the way, they decided to fly to Vancouver and then take the train. For both of them, the thought of crossing the whole country by rail was exciting.  Before starting out, they spent a couple of days in Vancouver, seeing the sights. During their first day, as is typical of Vancouver, it rained. Despite the weather, they were able to take a boat ride out into the bay, and later visit an island that had wonderful shops selling crafts and antiques. The next day was clear and mild, and they were pleased to see the beautiful mountains looking out over the city. Later, they took a pleasant hike in a forest just a short distance away.  The next morning, the two girls arose early to take the train to Lake Louise, passing through the Canadian Rockies. Seen from the train window, the mountains and forests of Canada looked massive. When the train arrived at the station, they took a taxi to Lake Louise, where the blue water literally took their breath away  with its exceptional beauty. They spent the night, and then took a coach bound north through the Canadian Rockies to Jasper. Looking at the beautiful scenery, they both agreed that it was the  most awesome journey they had ever  taken. In addition to seeing spectacular mountain peaks  and forests, one highlight of their trip was being able to see many different creatures, including deer, mountain goats, and even a grizzly bear and an eagle.  From Jasper, they caught the train towards Toronto. One of the trains first stops was in Edmonton, the provincial capital of Alberta, the centre of Canadas huge oil and gas drilling  industry. Edmonton is freezing cold in  winter, with daily temperatures averaging -10C. Since it  can be too cold to go outdoors, Edmonton is home to many shopping malls. In fact, one of the largest shopping malls in North America is in Edmonton.  38 UNIT 4 JOURNEY ACROSS A VAST LAND  From Edmonton, the train headed southeast across the great Canadian Prairie. At school, Daiyu and Liu Qian had learnt that Canadas population is only slightly over thirty-seven million. However, they did not anticipate seeing such an open country, and were truly amazed. They went through two wheat-growing provinces, where they saw a bunch of farms that covered a very large area.  After another day on the train, eventually they were back in an urban area, the city of Winnipeg. From there, they travelled through the night, and woke up in Ontarioa land of forests and lakes. The train thundered on, through the rolling hills. The bushes and maple trees outside their windows were red, gold, and orange, and there was frost on the ground, confirming that autumn had arrived in Canada. Night came again, and the train turned south towards Toronto. When they woke up the next morning and pulled back the curtain, they could see the wide stretch of Lake Huronone of the four Great Lakes on Ontarios southern border. It was not until 9:30 a.m. that they finally reached the capital of Ontario, Toronto. All in all, their trip from Vancouver to Toronto had taken a duration of four days.  3 Complete the table below with information from the article.

UNIT 4 JOURNEY ACROSS AVASTLAND = 43 44  Using Language  SEEING THE TRUE NORTH VIA RAIL: TORONTO AND MONTREAL  After Li Daiyu and her cousin arrived in Toronto, the largest and wealthiest city in Canada, they only had a few hours to kill before they had to proceed to the next leg of their trip to Montreal, so they went on a tour of the city. They went up the CN Tower and looked across the shores of Lake Ontario. Standing in the distance, they were astonished to see misty clouds rising from the great Niagara Falls, which is on the south side of the lake. Water from the lake flows into the Niagara River and over the falls on its way to the sea.  The girls saw hundreds of skyscrapers of glass and steel, and old-fashioned cars rolling by. As they walked north from the harbour area, Li Daiyu said, Lin Fei, one of my mother's old schoolmates, lives here. | should phone her and see if she's available for dinner.  They met Lin Fei around dusk over dinner at a restaurant in downtown Chinatown. The cousins chatted with Lin Fei, who had moved to Canada many years earlier.  This is the largest Chinatown in Toronto. We have a few more in the Greater Toronto Area, so you can guess that there are a lot of Chinese people in Canada! Chinese people have been coming here for more than a hundred years. Therefore, we can get all kinds of great food here from all over China, Lin Fei told them.  The train left late that night and arrived in Montreal early the next morning. At the station, in contrast to Toronto, they heard people talking in French. They were surprised to see that all the signs and advertisements were in French and many people spoke English with an accent.  We don't leave until this evening, said Liu Qian. Let's go downtown. Old Montreal is close to the water.  They spent the afternoon in lovely shops and visiting artists in their workplaces along St Paul Street. As they sat in a restaurant alongside the broad St Lawrence River, a young man sat down with them.  Hello, my name is Jean-Philippe. Im a photographer, he said, and | was wondering where you are from.  The girls told him they were from China and were on a train trip across Canada. When they told him they had only one day in Montreal, he said, That's too bad. You owe it to yourselves to stay longer. Overall, Montreal is a city with wonderful sights and sounds. Most of us speak both English and French, and the city has unique Quebec culture and traditions. There are fantastic restaurants and clubs around, too. Here, we love good coffee, toast, and cheese. And good music, of course!  UNIT 4 JOURNEY ACROSS A VAST LAND  That night the train was speeding along the St Lawrence River towards the Gulf of St Lawrence and down to the distant east Coast towards the province of Nova Scotia and its largest city, Halifax. The cousins dreamt happily of the beautiful cobblestone streets, old brick buildings, and the red maple leaves of Montreal.  2 Drawon the map a simple route of the girls trip across Canada and make notes about what the girls did at each place.  3 Imagine that you are Li Daiyu.

As you can imagine, getting burnt can lead to very serious injuries. The first and most important step in the treatment of burns is giving first aid.  CAUSES OF BURNS  You can get burnt by a variety of things: hot liquids, steam, fire, radiation, the sun, electricity, acids, or other chemicals.  TYPES OF BURNS Burns are divided into three types, depending on the depth of skin damage.  e First-degree burns These affect only the top few millimetres of the skin. These burns are not serious. Examples include mild sunburn and burns caused by other minor household incidents.  e Second-degree burns These go below the top layer of the skin. They are serious and take a few weeks to get better. Examples include burns caused by hot liquids.  e Third-degree burns These affect every layer of the skin, and sometimes the tissue under it. Examples include burns caused by electric shocks, burning clothes, or petrol fires. These burns cause very severe internal injuries and the victim must go to the hospital at once.  CHARACTERISTICS OF BURNS  First-degree burns Third-degree burns + dry, red, and mildly swollen + black and white  + mildly painful * swollen; the tissue underneath can often be + turn white when pressed seen  Second-degree burns : little or no pain if nerves are damaged; may + red and swollen; blisters; watery surface be painful around the edges of the burn " extremely painful  50 UNIT5 FIRST AID FIRST-AID TREATMENT  1  Place burns under cool running water, especially within the first ten minutes. The cool water stops the burning process and reduces the pain and swelling.  Dry the burnt area gently with a clean cloth.  Remove any clothes using scissors if necessary, unless you see the fabric sticking to the burnt skin.  Cover the burnt area with a loose clean cloth. Applying oil to the injured areas is a bad idea, as it will keep the heat in the wounds and may cause infection.  lf burns are on the face, make sure the victim can still breathe. If the victim is suffering from second or third-degree burns, there is an urgent need to take him/her to the hospital at once.  Read again and decide if the following statements are true (T) or false (F).  bond  Your skin gives you protection from many dangerous things.  A first-degree burn has this name because it is the most serious Second-degree burns can be the most painful kind of burn.  It is important to use cool water to stop the heat from remaining wound regardless of the degree of the burn.  Putting butter or oil on burns helps because it may reduce swell ease discomfort.  tT)  L TT) FO  mT) FO in the  TU] FC) ing and  tT) FU  4 Complete the table to summarise the information about first aid for burns.  5  Types Details First-degree burns Second-degree burns Third-degree burns of the of the of the skin skin skin and sometimes Depth underneath dry, red, and mildly red and swollen; black and white; swollen; ; mildly i can often Characteristics ; turn be seen; little or no pain if when surface; extremely are pressed damaged place under within the first ten minutes > the burnt area > clothes > the burn > Treatment  burn on the face: make sure the victim can third-degree burn: take the victim to  In groups, discuss the following questions.

Chen Wei, a high school student in Beijing, had his dinner interrupted when he heard someone screaming from another table. A fellow diner at the restaurant, Zhang Tao, was choking on some steak. He was now holding his throat with his face turning red, while his desperate friends were slapping him on the back.  . He got up and ran to Zhangs table at once. With the help of Zhang's friends, he was able to help Zhang to his feet. Then, standing behind Zhang, Chen did the Heimlich manoeuvre. The food was instantly forced out, and Silla Compeereneot a Zhang began to breathe again. Ten minutes later, an ambulance  arrived. The doctors checked Zhang and made sure that he was fine. They suggested he eat more slowly and take smaller bites before they left.  , leaving no time for an ambulance to arrive. To solve this problem, in 1974, an American doctor, Henry Heimlich, created the Heimlich manoeuvre, saving thousands of lives around the world. Doing the Heimlich manoeuvre is quick, practical, and easy. It is so easy, in fact, that almost anyone can learn how.  . Then, make sure that the victim is really choking: A choking person cannot speak. Slapping the victims back will often force out the obstruction. If this does not work, you can perform the Heimlich manoeuvre by standing behind him and wrapping your arms around his waist. Make a fist with one hand and place it in the upper part of his stomach. Grabbing your fist with your other hand tightly, push up and into his stomach in one motion. Continue doing this until the obstruction is forced out.

Al AND HUMAN BEINGS  Is it possible to make machines think like humans? This is one question in research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, or Al. To think like a human, it involves feelings, morality, hopes, and dreams. Humans are capable of making decisions by themselves without input from others, and they can learn from experience. In addition, humans are able to create things from their own inspiration for their own pleasure. The question is whether machines can ever really think in all these aspects.  The idea of a computer that is all-powerful and can think and make decisions for itself terrifies many people. In some films, Al even decides that all humans must be killed. Many people are also concerned that Al will be used to replace humans.  Yet others are comforted by the thought of Al. Maybe with Al, robots can be made to replace loved ones who have died. Today, the creation of an all-  powerful computer capable of human thought is still in progress. We have companion robots, and it is likely that they will grow more important in our lives as time goes by. However, the need for such robots does not seem to be as critical as our need for intelligent machines that can solve problems by learning from their observations and experience.  For example, Al is already being used with great success in Internet search engines and as a personal assistant in our smartphones. It learns from our habits to help us find what we want and like. Al is also used to diagnose problems and suggest  solutions. Researchers are also experimenting with the use of Al in driverless cars which can sense their surroundings and decide on the best way to reach a destination. It is also being used in education, particularly in online courses. Furthermore, industries that use robots for repetitive or dangerous work often turn to Al to manage these electronic workers. In addition, virtual assistants are also being used in some homes today. In the near future, it is likely that Al will be used to manage smart homes and handle an even greater variety of tasks such as setting out favourite clothes and helping us with our personal grooming.  The Al of today has already proven its superiority to humans in many areas. Do you think that we can create a robot that thinks like a human or one that is even more intelligent? If So, is there truly a difference between Al and a human?

The crowd ignores the many beautiful paintings on the walls and pushes to the rooms far end. There, they gaze at a single small painting of a smiling woman. So many people have crowded in to have a look at the painting that most can only get a quick look at it. Then they are forced to move on.  This painting is the Mona Lisa created in the early 16th century by the Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci. It was kept away from the public until 1797, when it was put on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Art critics only first began to notice the painting in the 1850s. Then, in 1911, the painting was stolen. By the time the painting was finally recovered in 1914, it had become an international sensation. Many agreed that it was one of the greatest paintings ever made, by one of the worlds greatest painters.  Even as a young boy, da Vinci showed promise as an artist. When he was fourteen years old, he was sent to learn art in Florence, Italy. He trained for seven years, and then struck out on his own, working for wealthy men throughout Italy, and later for the king of France. Even  though Leonardo began his career as a painter, he most  often worked as an engineer. One reason was that he painted very slowly, and sometimes did not even finish his work. Another reason was  that Italy was at war, and geet people needed engineers  rod et  \ deme al hae ee ee aig  { <  ea    66  a : - UNIT 1 SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS  to help build city defences more than they needed artists. However, even though da Vinci worked as an engineer, he still found time to paint, creating some of his greatest artworks during this period.  After da Vinci's death, it was discovered that he had kept many notebooks describing and illustrating his work, his inventions, and his scientific research. While his notebooks were collected and prized by the kings of Europe, none of them were published until the late 19th century. Until then, few people had had any idea what they contained.  As it turned out, his notebooks are an amazing treasure box of drawings of people, animals, plants, and fantastic inventions, such as airplanes, tanks, robots, and diving equipment. Then, there are accurate studies of the human body, showing bones and muscles with such detail that would not be seen elsewhere for four hundred years. Along with these drawings are notes describing his work. Oddly, many of these notes are written backwards: You have to hold them up to the mirror in order to read them. Many of these notes are scientific in nature, involving his research in many different fields. His notebooks show that he was not only the greatest artist of his time, but the greatest scientist as well.  This raises the question: What was more important to da Vinci, science or art? Da Vinci once said, Practice must always be founded on sound theory ... The painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any reason, is like a mirror which copies everything placed in front of it but does not know those things exist. Here, reason means an understanding of what is being painted. In da Vinci's mind, before he could paint something, he had to examine it, take it apart, and even see how it worked. Thus, his scientific research served his art.  Yet, this is too simple of a picture of the man. Da Vinci was always full of excitement to explore, to discover, and to create. He saw no division between art, invention, and sciencethey were all a part of his wonderful new world of discovery. Thus, some of da Vinci's paintings were really science experiments, in that they used new chemicals and processes from his research. At the same time, his scientific drawings are considered beautiful pieces of art in their own right, and many of them were created to help him understand what he was painting. Da Vincis desire to create and his interest in the world around him drove both his art and his science.  So what can we learn from this? Few of us will ever be as gifted and intelligent as da Vinci. Yet, all of us can learn from his spirit. We can produce things of beauty, create new inventions, and increase our scientific knowledge. Furthermore, we can be creative in solving difficult problems. While none of us may ever be able to paint something as beautiful as the Mona Lisa, we can all do our small part to make the world a better place.  67 TR oan en ho UNIT2   a  Using Words and Expressions  Change the following verbs to nouns.

He would be away from his parents for the next nine years. This young boy was Zhan Tianyou, who was destined to play a major role in the development of China's railroads. Zhan Tianyou was one of the first 30 boys chosen to be part of the Chinese Educational Mission (CEM), which had been founded by the Chinese government at the time with the goal of helping China to develop and strengthen through education.   was not easy, however, to recruit 30 boys whose parents were willing to part with their sons for fifteen years, which was the original plan of the CEM. No one knew what to expect if their children were to be separated from them by thousands of miles for more than a decade. Few people had any experience travelling to countries outside China, and many were afraid of foreigners. A friend persuaded Zhan Tianyous father to send his son for the CEM admission test, and eventually Zhan Tianyou joined the small group of boys sailing across the Pacific to the USA.  After the ship reached the US west coast, Zhan Tianyou and the other students had to travel by train across America to reach their schools on the east coast. On the way, the young Chinese boy drank in the amazing natural scenery, the culture and customs, and the developing American industrial civilisation. Looking back years later, he remembered that he had been especially impressed by the amazing railroads and trains.  Zhan Tianyou and his fellow students received a warm welcome from the school and their homestay families when they finally arrived in the state of Connecticut. For the first two years in Connecticut, Zhan Tianyou attended the Seaside Institute for Boys, where he became very close friends with the headmaster and his family. The headmasters wife, Mrs Martha Northrop, was an especially good friend and positive influence, encouraging the young Chinese boy to study science and engineering after he displayed a talent for maths. Many years later, Zhan Tianyou wrote to Mrs Northrop to express his great gratitude for her kindness and help during those early years.  During his two years at the boys school, Zhan Tianyou embraced as many opportunities as he could to learn about this new world. He took part in all sorts of sports, games, and other activities: swimming, skating, ball games, fishing, riding bicycles, playing chess, and more. He also became interested in travel and reading, especially Mark Twains novels. When he entered high school, he continued to participate in many different sports and other activities, even forming a baseball team with the other Chinese students attending the high school. Their team often competed with teams from different parts of the USA.  73 WORKBOOK - -  Zhan Tianyou did not, however, neglect his studies to pursue sports or play games. He greatly expanded his understanding of science and Western culture, took part in natural and social research, and eventually graduated first in his class and second in the whole school.  While in high school, Zhan Tianyou became increasingly interested in the rapid development of modern science and technology. He was impressed by the new American railroad system and the hard work of the Chinese workers who helped to build it. During a visit to Philadelphia, he was amazed by the many displays of science and technology at the Centennial Exposition (later renamed the World Fair). He was also saddened to see that only a few items were displayed by the Chinese representatives at the exposition: mostly tea, silk, and porcelain.  Those first five years of observation and experience, the great encouragement of his good friend Mrs Northrop, and his great desire to help his home country led him to a very clear choice of major in college: civil engineering, with an emphasis on railroad construction. He had seen first-hand how building railroads had greatly assisted Americas growth, and he felt that China would benefit similarly from having railroads.  Therefore, at the age of 17, Zhan Tianyou entered Yale Universitys Sheffield Scientific School to study civil engineering. His hard work won him a scholarship and a medal in maths during his time there. He graduated in 1881 with a Ph.B. degree, ranking first in the graduation exams. Of the 120 Chinese boys who came to the US through the CEM, only Zhan Tianyou and another student completed college degrees, as in the summer of 1881, the Qing government decided to recall the CEM students.  Zhan Tianyou returned to China with a great desire to use his education and experience to build up his country. Seven years later, in 1888, he finally began to realise his dream of building a railroad system in China. He became particularly famous for his amazing work on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway, a railway line built across some of the most difficult geographical conditions in China. Zhan Tianyou, now known as the Father of Chinas Railroad, served his country for 31 years, improving life for millions of people.  a UNIT 3   Using Words and Expressions  1  Match the noun phrases on the right with the adjectives that collocate with them.  1 fundamental A tools to eat noodles with  2 consistent Bcolours of the fruit bowls  3 ideal C environment in the restaurant  4 vivid D improvement in cuisine development  5 overall E differences between Italian cuisine and Chinese cuisine  Complete the sentences with the correct forms of the words in the box.  limit chairman protein category chew calorie dessert pork madam somewhat quantity canteen/cafeteria association 1 I'mglad that I'm consuming fewer  this week.

CONVENIENCE FOOD OR FRESH FOOD?  A new survey indicates that young people in China much prefer making fresh food to buying prepared food. Mei Lin, for example, is 22 and she is a college graduate from Anhui. Mei Lin has stopped buying cheap food at the supermarket. I would much prefer my own bowl of noodles with fresh vegetables and a few spices to the packaged noodles | can buy in a store. Its fresher and healthier, especially since | lead an active life. Mei Lin often goes jogging in the evening and plays tennis at the weekend, in addition to swimming and training for a marathon in Xiamen in the autumn. She believes her fresh food choices help her stay fit and active.  But the trend isnt one that only women are taking up. Su Bo, a 26-year-old computer programmer in Shenzhen, says that he has given up eating packaged meals except when hes travelling for work. For me, its a matter of wanting to be healthy and having enough energy. | have a very demanding job, and | need a sharp mind and strong body. It does take more time to go shopping, but | find my energy levels are higher when | eat fresh food. Su Bo used to order many of his meals online, so that he could spend more time working, but he soon stopped this habit. | realised it wasnt good to never take a break from my job, he said. Besides, the food often made me ill. For Su Bo this meant cooking his own vegetables, eating less meat, and carrying fruit to work for lunch. Sometimes | buy one or two baozi from the food store on the corner, but | usually make and bring my own lunch to work. Like Mei Lin, Su Bo insists that eating healthy food helps him with his fitness routine.  Both admit that in times of stress or busy periods at work, they do sometimes give in and eat fast food or packaged meals. Sometimes | just have to eat something on the run, says Mei Lin. But | always regret it. | am so used to my diet now that when | eat less healthy food, | feel tired. | exercise less as a result. Su Bo insists that he does still sometimes enjoy eating on the go. But | almost always eat healthy meals. Because | live at home and my mother prefers to eat like | do, we often cook together. Its my father who likes to eat fast food in front of the TV, he laughs.  When asked whether their eating habits are common among their age group, both Mei Lin and Su Bo say they are. Yet, its not clear whether this food trend will be adopted by other young Chinese people. Are Mei Lin and Su Bo unique or are they setting a new trend? Its too early to say.  COMMENTS:  @runnerSZ95 | agree with this.

Farm-to-table as a social movement has its origins in a famous San Francisco restaurant called Chez Panisse. Chef Alice Waters worked hard to learn where all of her ingredients came from, preferring 4 ORGANIC C ae whenever possible to find local food to serve  in her restaurants. She did this because she  preferred to have relationships with the people who supplied her food. A sense of trust soon developed between the staff of Chez Panisse and the farmers, and this meant reliable sources of produce for the restaurants customers. Since the food isnt being shipped to the other side of the world, it can be picked when it is in season, allowing the plants to develop fully, resulting in better flavour and nutrition.  Imagine sitting in a restaurant in a Western ae city and hearing from the waiter that the eggs RM CA _ youre about to eat came from a farm 20 miles FA ES E> outside the city, that the onions came from a ram) E> farm just across the road, that the peppers Basa =  were grown in the restaurants own garden, ca f= and the cheese was made across town. This Wie tra | es is a farm-to-table restaurant. At weal IE iw | mm UV  Ll  Though the farm-to-table trend started in the restaurant world, customers soon started demanding that supermarkets label where their foods come from. If youve ever bought blueberries from Quebec, bananas from Costa Rica, or grapes from Chile, you have seen first-hand the farm-to- table movement in action. Its common in most supermarkets today in Western countriesand s= even in many Asian countriesfor products to list the country of origin. This gives customers an idea of how fresh the food is likely to be or how far it has come from. This knowledge, people argue, helps customers make the best choices for themselves and their families.  The farm-to-table movement rides on the crest of the wave with three other movements: the slow food movement, the movement towards fresh seasonal ingredients, and the organic food movement. The term slow food was chosen to set it apart from fast food, but it really is not slow in the sense of eating or cooking food slowly. Rather, the slow food movement celebrates traditional food made with local ingredients and traditional cooking techniques. It sees a strong link between food and culture, and wants to protect     UNT3 FOOD AND CULTURE  local food heritage as a way of protecting local culture. As such, it heavily depends on local farmers and other food producers. While not all farm-to-table restaurants are part of the slow food movement, all slow food restaurants are essentially farm-to-table.  Prior to modern food processing and storage techniques and the use of greenhouses, most food was essentially seasonal in nature. That is, you could only find certain food ingredients at certain times of the year. As a consequence, people looked forward to seasons and seasonal celebrations in large part because of the food available at that time. Modern technology has made food much more convenient, but with that it has also taken away some of the things that made food wonderful. Not only is our food often lacking in flavour and nutrition, but we have lost touch with some of our cultural heritage and the rhythms of nature, and the joy of anticipation has been lost. As a consequence, many people are embracing seasonal cuisine by consuming only fresh ingredients that are in season. Farm-to-table goes hand-in-hand with this new emphasis, as this is one way to ensure that only fresh seasonal ingredients are being used, rather than ingredients which have been processed, which have been stored for many months at a time, or which originated in greenhouses.  The idea behind organic food is that food is grown and processed in ways that use as few chemicals as possible. This is seen as being better for our health, and better for the earth. The farm-to-table movement believes that food should be grown, shipped, stored, and prepared as naturally as possible.  Fraud, however, has become a problem in the farm-to-table movement. Investigations have shown that some supermarkets, for example, have claimed that their apples came from Washington when they really came from Mexico, and restaurants have claimed that a fish is One species when its a different one. Why does this matter? Because farm-to-table is a movement about trust: trust that food is grown in healthy and clean environments, and trust that the people who buy such food have developed personal relationships with the people who grow it.  Some people do not support the farm-to-table movement. They insist that the nutritional value of local food is not any greater than mass-produced food shipped from far away. At the same time, local food can cost a lot more. This has resulted in some saying that farm-to-table is a movement that meets the desires of people with money, but does not really address any actual nutritional or environmental concerns. Poor people, in other words, cannot afford to worry about where their food comes from. It is true that many poor people in the West cannot afford to buy farm-to-table food from expensive supermarkets. On the other hand, in most developing countries poor people already have farm-to-table diets because they live on or near farms and this is the only food available.  Whether farm-to-table is a long-term trend or a passing fad isnt clear. But people today are more demanding when it comes to getting information about their food from restaurants and market owners. This new type of communication between customers and businesses is unlikely to go away anytime soon.

It is 10 in the morning, and | am travelling by raft down the Li River. The sun is already burning hot even though it has not yet reached full strength, but a calm breeze cools my skin. So far the day is wonderful, but the purpose of my trip is not just to have fun: | am following in the footsteps of Xu Xiake (1587-1641), the famous Chinese travel writer and geographer. Though Xu was from Jiangsu, he spent more than 30 years travelling throughout the country, and greatly admired my destination today Ox Gorge.  As we flow down the river, we are surrounded by steep hills sticking up into the skykarsts. Unique among mountains, karsts were formed over thousands of years as rain drained into the acidic soil and melted the soft rock, leaving the harder rock behind. Guangxi is | full of karsts, giving it some of the most interestingand beautiful scenery in the world. Xu was one of the first people to make a careful study of Guilins karsts and their related cave systems. He, like many people today, found them fascinating.  Suddenly, our raft hits some rapids, and | find myself covered in water. | turn to my raftsman and we share a laugh. The water not only keeps us cool, but it is all part of the adventure.  What made someone like Xu spend years travelling thousands of kilometres away from home? Perhaps its the same reason as mine: to explore the world and to discover new things. As Xu wrote, A great man should in the morning be at the blue sea, and in the evening at Mount Cangwu. Why should | restrict myself to one corner of the world?  Xu was not alone. Much like today, the late Ming Dynasty was a golden age of tourism within China. People travelled hundreds of kilometres to visit temples, go mountain climbing, or explore scenery.  es  WRU RISOIK, |e et    86  Yet, perhaps no one in China travelled farther or longer than Xu Xiake. At least, if anyone did they did not write about it.  When our raft reaches Ox Gorge, it proves to be every bit as beautiful as | expecteda watery heaven on earth. The raft is tied up, and then | head out to explore. That afternoon, | find a cave on the river. | wade into it and the water grows shallower, until finally | am walking on dry land.

Soon, like my new friends, | am covered in gray mud from head to toe. After an hour of play, | head back out of the cave and take a swim in the river to get clean. And | wonder, when Xu Xiake came here nearly five hundred years ago, did he examine the mud like a scientist? Or did he jump in?  Of course he jumped in. You know he did.  Read the article again and answer the questions.  Why did the author decide to go to Guilin?  How are karsts and their related cave systems formed?  According to the author, why did Xu Xiake like to travel?  What did the author do in the cave?  Do you agree with the author that Xu Xiake probably played in the mud? Why or why not?  ahonNdD   In groups, discuss why Xu Xiake liked to go on long journeys, what difficulties he probably faced, and what things he enjoyed.

We se se  ; s  UNIT4 JOURNEY ACROSS AVASTLAND   *Expanding Your World  JOURNEYS BY DOG SLED  ., About 120 years ago, gold was discovered in the Yukon, in northern Canada, starting a gold rush as tens of thousands of menand womentravelled there from around the world in the hope of making their fortunes. There were no real roads in that area back then, so it was difficult to travel overland in summer. However, once the ground was covered in ice and snow, one could travel long distances quickly by sled. Of course, the winter weather was too harsh for horsesthey would die in the cold. Dogs, on the other hand, thrived in the cold because of their thick fur, so thenand even nowdogs were used on long journeys through the : snow carrying people and goods on sleds. As a young man, Jack London joined the gold rush and journeyed from California to Alaska and the Yukon. Though, like most miners, he did not get rich looking for gold, he saw first-hand how dogs were a necessary part of travel in the far north. Some friends he met there had a large dog, a husky and St Bernard mixed breed. This dog seemed particularly tough and healthy and served as inspiration for the main dog character in London's novel, The Call of the Wild.  London thought of his time in the north as one of his lifes greatest adventures. When he returned to * California, he was unable to find a job. Those were difficult times in California, which we still isolated alls = ~=6WHITEHORS cut off from much of the American economy. With CAPITAL OF THE Alaska fresh in his mind, he tried to sell the story of his _ = a journey up north to several publishers and magazines,  but no one seemed interested. Later, London wrote a short story about a dog in the far north who survives many adventures and ends up killing his master. But almost immediately after its publication, London regretted it and felt that he needed to set the story straight by showing how noble and loyal dogs were, especially dogs in the far north, where travel and survival was difficult. It was this that started him writing his famous novel, The Cail of the Wild. The new story was quickly picked up by a magazine and serialised into four parts. It became extremely popular. Later, it was published in book format and has never been out of print since.   Welcome to  The hero of London's novel was Buck, a large family dog owned by a wealthy judge:  Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his  he was kingking over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included. His father, Elmo, a huge St Bernard, had been the Judge's inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so largehe weighed only one hundred and forty poundsfor his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his  87  WORKBOOK  : -   puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.  Bucks life was wonderful and happy, until he was stolen and sold to men who took him to Canada, where he became a sled dog used for travel in the harsh Yukon winter. The book was an early example of an adventure tale told from an animals point of view, by an animal with human emotions and ways of seeing the world:  Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm was it, that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared. He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz particularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size.  The excerpt above shows how London created a dog that not only had qualities that humans recognise in dogs, but also an emotional complexity that humans also recognise in each other. In this way, London was able to create a character that was both non-human and human. This made the adventure tale engaging and fascinating, offering urban Americans insight into what life in the far north was like for dogs and humans.  Just as Buck as a dog is used to pull sleds on long journeys, the story itself is one of a long inner journey. Buck begins his life in a comfortable, loving home where he must depend upon his human master for everything. But later he is forced to survive under harsh circumstances in a difficult environment. There, however, he finds a strength that he did not realise he had, and becomes an essential part of his owners life. Yet, as much as his human owner needs Buck for survival, Buck discovers that he no longer needs humans. So, when his owner dies, he escapes into the forest and joins the wolves, finally discovering true freedom and independence.  Sadly, Jack London died young in 1916 at the age of 40. There is debate about how he died exactly, as London had suffered from several painful diseases in the last years of his life, including scurvy which had been caused by his travels in the Yukon earlier in life. After his death, interest in The Call of the Wild, and some of his other works, grew much stronger. Romantic ideas of the tragic author who passed away when he was still young and handsome made his works even more popular. Today, The Call of the Wild is considered one of the most important novels of American literature, and students in high school and college are often required to read it.

Peter was walking over to help the boy, when he heard a man shouting Stop! Dont move! Peter turned and saw a man running towards  him with a serious face. Don't touch him! You could get killed! the man shouted. Call an ambulance! Peter ran to a shop nearby to call for help. Went back into the street, he saw the man uses a long piece of wood to move the power line away from the boy. Having freed of the power line, the boy was picked up and carried a safe distance away. Stop people from coming near the power line! the man told Peter. The man then started doing CPR on the boy. A crowd began to grow, and Peter tried his best to keep them away from the power line. Finally, an ambulance and the fire brigade arrived. The medics began looking after the boy while fire fighters took care of the power line. Unable to see what was happening, Peter was quite worried about the boy. After twenty minutes, Peter felt happy when he saw the medics lifting the boy, now is talking, into the ambulance.  20  25  30 Listening and Speaking  O14  Listen to the conversation about first-aid techniques.

For other people, however, this calling comes unexpectedly, like a lion that attacks its prey by surprise. This was certainly true of Swiss businessman Henry Dunant. In 1859, Dunant travelled to Italy wanting to see Napoleon Ill, the Emperor of France. At the age of 31, Dunant was already a successful businessman. However, he needed the help of Napoleon Ill for one of his business deals. At the time, France was fighting with the Italian army in a war against Austria. Dunant knew that Napoleon II! would be with his army in northern Italy, so he travelled to the city of Solferino to look for him.  Dunant arrived on the night of 24 June and found a battlefield filled with 40,000 dead and wounded soldiers. Dunant was horrified by the scene and was filled with compassion for the wounded men. At once, Dunant forgot all about seeing Napoleon Ill and began attending to the wounded men. In the days that followed, he led local people in helping take care of the wounded and dying. They looked after the soldiers without regard to country or uniform, saying, All are brothers! After all the wounded in Solferino had either died or been taken away, Dunant went to military hospitals and continued to act as a volunteer, helping as best as he could.  When Dunant returned to Switzerland the following month, he wrote a book about his experience called A Memory of Solferino. The book ends with a simple question: Would it not be possible, in time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose of having care given to the wounded in wartime by zealous, devoted, and thoroughly qualified volunteers? This question eventually led to the forming of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863.  The first act of the Red Cross was to organise an international conference | (the Geneva Convention) where countries adopted guidelines and measures for protecting the wounded and medical workers during and after battles. In the years since then, the Red Cross has been active in just  94 about every war, helping to care for both soldiers and civilians. While the Red Cross is mostly tasked with helping people in times of war, | it also responds to natural disasters and gives aid to people who have to leave their homes. For example, the Red Cross provided aid and relief after the May 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, 3 China.  All around the world, the Red Cross continues to help civilians caught in war, providing medical assistance, feeding the needy, and offering many other types of aid. To help meet the need for aid, most countries have National R Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Not only do these societies provide support to Red Cross efforts in other countries, but they also help prepare their own communities for disasters, provide medical services, and teach first-aid and life-saving techniques.  Much of the work done by volunteers and workers in the Red Cross is difficult. They tend to work in places of crisis, where there is war, conflict, or disaster, and where conditions are quite poor. However, their work is also both rewarding and important. They provide food, shelter, medical supplies, and medical care to those in need. They help prepare communities and gather supplies and materials for future disasters. And, in many cases, they remain at work even after conflicts and disasters have passed, and lead development efforts.  Sometimes the work is even dangerous. Since 1993, about 40 workers for the International Red Cross have been killed. However, Red Cross workers think that it is worth it. As one Red Cross volunteer said, We are the Red Crosswe will be there. No matter how hard it is, we will be there.  Most of the people who receive help from the Red Cross are very grateful for the help, and some even want to return the favour and help others now that they themselves have received help. For example, Salaymana is now a volunteer with the Italian Red Cross. In 2016, he escaped from conflict in his home country in Africa by getting on a boat to Italy. Crossing the Mediterranean in a small boat was very hard, and many of the people who travelled with him died during the journey. However, when Salaymana arrived in Italy, the first people he met were Red Cross volunteers, who gave him food, medical attention, a place to stay, and much needed comfort. As Salaymana said later, | am very happy now. They are my brothers, and the Red Cross is always in my heart.  Dunant himself gave up everything he had to help others. His business failed because he was too busy a his wor in the Bes ee Then Sg had to leave the Red Cross because of a personal : i s conflict. Despite this, he continued to work as a i volunteer, helping provide relief to people caught | up in war. In the end, he lost all his money, fell | ill, and had to be taken in by a charity.
