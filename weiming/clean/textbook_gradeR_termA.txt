Decide on what you want to learn. Do you want to learn spelling rules? Do you want to learn how to take notes during a talk by a teacher?  No matter what you want to learn, it is important to decide on your goal before you make a plan.  Use the right strategy.

THE FRESHMAN CHALLENGE  Hi! My name is Adam and Im a freshman at senior high school. Going from junior high school to senior high school is a really big challenge. The first week was a little confusing.  First, I had to think very carefully about which courses I wanted to take. The school adviser helped me choose the suitable ones: maths, English, chemistry, world history, and Chinese. I know that Chinese is a very difficult language, but I hope to be fluent when I graduate. My adviser recommended that I should sign up for advanced literature because I like English and Im good at it.  I had to choose extra-curricular activities, too. I tried to join the school football team, but the coach told me that I didnt play well enough. Obviously, I was unhappy, but I wont quit. I'll find a way to improve on my own so that I can make the team next year. I joined a volunteer club instead. Every Wednesday, we work at a soup kitchen and hand out food to homeless people in the  community.  I know Ill have to study harder as a senior high school student and get used to being responsible for a lot more. Im a bit worried about keeping up with the other students in my advanced course, and itll be quite difficult to get used to all the homework. Still, m happy to be here. Studying hard isnt always fun, but TH be well prepared for university or whatever else comes in the future. 3 Read the text again and answer the questions.  1 2 3 4  What courses did Adam choose? Which one do you think would be his favourite? Why? What does make the team in Paragraph 3 mean? What is Adam worried about?  Is Adam confident that he will get used to senior high school life?

But did you know that 9 percent is also the number of children who are not at school? Thats rightone in 11 children is not studying and probably even cannot do the simple maths you just did so very easily. They drop out of school because their families are too poor and they have to work like adults. In 2013, millions of children and teenagers were out of school. Most live  in poor countries, but there are also some boys and girls who cannot go to school in rich countries. If you are one of the lucky ones who can go to a senior high school, you should be grateful for the opportunity.

Cusco was the capital city of the Inca E which was the most powerful in South America until the 1500s. There are two especially interesting things to a about the Inca civilisation. The first is the roads and p they built to connect their important cities. These Inca roads were made up of two north-south highways and many small roads crossing the mountains east to west. The roads were for Inca soldiers and their o  place in the history  . Second, the Incas built wonderful cities full of amazing architecture but there were no markets in these cities.

Discuss what can happen to a city during a big earthquake.  @) 2 Look at the title and photo below and guess what the text is about. Then read and check if you are right.  THE NIGHT THE EARTH DIDNT SLEEP  Strange things were happening in the countryside of northeastern Hebei. For several days, the water in the village wells rose and fell, rose and fell. There were deep cracks that appeared in the well walls. At least one well had some smelly gas coming out of it. Chickens and even pigs were too nervous to eat, and dogs refused to go inside buildings. Mice ran out of the fields looking for places to hide, and fish jumped out of the water. At about 3:00 a.m., on 28 July 1976, bright lights were seen in the sky outside the city of Tangshan and loud noises were heard. But the citys one million people were asleep as usual that night.  At 3:42 a.m., everything began to shake. It seemed as if the world were coming to an end! Eleven kilometres directly below the city, one of the most deadly earthquakes of the 20th century had begun, a quake that even caused damage more than 150 kilometres away in Beijing. Nearly one third of the whole nation felt it! A huge crack, eight kilometres long and 30 metres wide, cut across houses, roads, and waterways. Hard hills of rock became rivers of dirt. In less than one minute, a large city lay in ruins. Two thirds of the people who lived there were dead or injured. Thousands of children were left without parents. The number of people who were killed or badly injured in the quake was more than 400,000.  Everywhere survivors looked, there was nothing but ruins. Nearly everything in the city was destroyed. About 75 percent of the citys factories and buildings, 90 percent of its homes, and all of its hospitals were gone. Bricks covered the ground like red autumn leaves, but no wind could blow them away. Most bridges had fallen or were not safe to cross. The railway tracks were now useless pieces of metal. Tens of thousands of cows, hundreds of thousands of pigs, and millions of chickens were dead. Sand now filled the wells instead of water. People were in shockand then, later that afternoon, another big quake shook Tangshan again. Even more buildings fell down. Water, food, and electricity were hard to get. People began to wonder how long the disaster would last.  But hope was not lost. Soon after the quakes, the army sent 150,000 soldiers to Tangshan to dig out those who were trapped and to bury the dead. More than 10,000 doctors and nurses came to provide medical care. Workers built shelters for survivors whose homes had been destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people were helped. Water and food were brought into the city by train, truck, and plane. Slowly, the city began to breathe again.  Tangshan started to revive itself and get back up on its feet. With strong support from the government and the tireless efforts of the city's people, a new Tangshan was built upon the earthquake ruins. The new city has become a home to more than seven million people, with great improvements in transportation, industry, and environment. Tangshan city has proved to China and the rest of the world that in times of disaster, people must unify and show the wisdom to stay positive and rebuild for a brighter future.  3 Read the text carefully and then write down the main idea of each paragraph.

OVER 6,500 DEAD  By Robert Woodhouse Monday, 27 December 2004  The most powerful earth- quake in the past 40 years caused a tsunami that crashed into coastlines across Asia yesterday, killing more than 6,500 people in Indonesia, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and at least four other countries. Fishermen, tourists, hotels, homes, and cars were swept away by huge waves caused by the strong earthquake that reached a magnitude of 9.0. The undersea quake struck around 7:00 a.m., Sunday off the west coast of Indonesias Sumatra Island. In that area  alone, at least 1,870 people were killed.  In Sri Lanka, some 1,600 kilometres west of the quake centre, the number of deaths stood at 2,498, and one million more were affected by the tsunami, government officials said. Indian officials said as many as 1,900 had been killed along the southern coast. Another 254 were found dead in Thailand and 54 in three other countries. In southern Thailand, 1,900 people were hurt and many more were missing, local officials said.  1 When did the tsunami happen?  2 What caused the tsunami?  3 Why would it be difficult to deliver food and supplies?  54  UNIT 4 NATURAL DISASTERS  The Daily News  hae  T was having breakfast with my three children when water started filling my home.

Predict what the text will be about.  @) 2 Read the text quickly to find the main idea of each paragraph.  THE CHINESE WRITING SYSTEM: CONNECTING THE PAST AND THE PRESENT  China is widely known for its ancient civilisation which has continued all the way through into modern times, despite the many ups and downs in its history. There are many reasons why this has been possible, but one of the main factors has been the Chinese writing system.  At the beginning, written Chinese was a picture-based language. It dates back several thousand years to the use of Jongguanimal bones and shells on which symbols were carved by ancient Chinese people. Some of the ancient symbols can still be seen in todays hanzi.  By the Shang Dynasty (around 1600- 1046 BCE), these symbols had become a well-developed writing system. Over the years, the system developed into different forms, as it was a time when people were divided geographically, leading to many varieties of dialects and characters. This, however, changed under Emperor Qinshihuang of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BCE).  Emperor Qinshihuang united the seven major states into one unified country where the Chinese writing system began to develop in one direction. That writing system was of great importance in uniting the Chinese people and culture. Even today, no matter where Chinese people live or what dialect they speak, they can all still communicate in writing.  Written Chinese has also become an important means by which Chinas present is connected with its past. People in modern times can read the classic works which were written by Chinese in ancient times. The high regard for the Chinese writing system can be seen in the development of Chinese characters as an art form, known as Chinese calligraphy, which has become an important part of Chinese culture.  Today, the Chinese writing system is still an important part of Chinese culture.

THE FACE-DOWN GENERATION  If you're reading this, you were probably born in the 2000s. The oh-ohs. The 21st century. That would make you young, creative, connected, global, and no doubt smart. Maybe good- looking, too. Right? But what do other people think about your generation?  Some adults worry that youre more interested in the screen in front of you than the world around you. They think of you as the face- down generation because you use your phone so much and they wonder how you will deal with school, friends, and family. Are todays teenagers too busy texting and taking selfies to become successful in real lifeor IRL, as you would say?  Other adults worry that todays youth are spoilt ( 2444 ) and dont want to face the challenges of adult life. Many children born in the 1990s and 2000s were raised by helicopter parents who were always there to guide and help them with a busy schedule filled with homework and extra-curricular activities such as dancing, drawing, or sports. With parents who do everything for them, todays youth seem to prefer to live like teenagers even when they are in their 20s or 30s.  Does the face-down generation need a heads-up? Well, probably not. The fact is that many of todays teenagers are better educated and more creative than past generations. They also seem to be enthusiastic (   ) and willing to become leaders. More young people than ever volunteer to help their communities. There are also brave young people such as Malala Yousafzai, the teenager who won the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for pushing girls rights to go to school.  So if you're one of the oh-ohs, theres reason to be hopeful about the future. Things are looking up for the face-down generation. Chances are that you will do GR8 (great) and LOL (laugh out loud).  2 Read the text carefully and answer the questions.  74  Was the writer born in the 2000s? How do you know?

Reading  What is its main idea?  BE A GOOD TOURIS  Tourism can be both good and bad. Yes, it brings in money for the local economy and creates lots of jobs for locals, but it may also bring some problems. i  | One growing problem is tourists who want to prove that they have visited a destination. | Tourists have used paint, rocks, or even keys to write on the Luxor Temple in Egypt, the Colosseum in Rome, Stonehenge in the UK, memorial stones at the bottom of Qomolangma, and many, many other places. Thousands of tourist sites are being destroyed by tourists | who love them to death. | have three words for people like this: please stop it. If you want to leave a mark on the world, do it by changing someone's life with kindness and love. Pass kindness along to future generations, not destruction (  ).  Another big problem in some places has been tourists disturbing (  ) the local people and life. Some tourists wander around and take pictures of local people without asking for their permission. For example, Chiang Mai University in Thailand and Yonsei University in South Korea have great numbers of tourists visiting their campuses and walking through their libraries and other public areas, taking pictures of students, and disturbing their studies. | Another example is Sanlitun, a neighbourhood in Beijing, China. Some tourists love to party there late into the night, making it difficult for locals to sleep. | have three words for tourists like this: please be considerate. Have fun in a way that does not disturb others.  The number of problems from tourists is endless: walking in large groups without considering others who need to walk by, crossing roads without thinking of local traffic laws, and many more.

The houses are well-built; the streets open, straight, and well-paved; the shops well-furnished; and the markets well-su plied. There are some beautiful palaces. The churches are built with taste and well decorated. There is a stone wharf on each side of the Arno River (    ) which runs through the city, and there are three bridges over it. The number of people there is rather small. This gives the place an air of wonderful quietness, which is  very pleasant.  OF course, | visited the beautiful leaning tower, which is eight floors high, each having, a round of columns, rising one above another. It leans so far on one side that if you dropped a stone from the top, which is 188 feet high, it would fall 16 feet from the base of the tower. ! would have never dreamt that this would have happened for any other reason than an accident; but some people have said that it was done on purpose  by the architect! Anyone with eyes can see that the columns on one side have sunk rather far. These leaning, towers are not uncommon in Italy; there is one in Bologna ( ), another in Venice ( ) a third between Venice and Ferrara ( #414), anda fourth at Ravenna ( 42444).  A most interesting person you might meet in Italy is the Improvisatore; this is what they call certain people who have the surprising, ability to make up poems on any subject you suggest. Mr Corvesi, my landlord, has a son who is amazingly good at this. When a subject is given, his brother picks up his violin to play along as he begins to make up poems with wonderful speed and skill. He will, at a minutes warning, recite two or three hundred beautifully written verses, with compliments to the listeners! The Italians are so fond of poetry that many of them have memorised the best parts of their great poets; these are the sources from which the Improvisatori take their rhymes, rhythms, and expressions.  8 Tobias Smollett Pisa today  82 UNIT 3 = = a ns  SPORTSANDFITNESS   Using Words and Expressions  1 Match the two parts to make definitions. 1983.

What is the difference between a player of a sport and a master of a sport? A sports psychologist (   ) suggests there are four things that all great athletes have in common. First, all great athletes love competition. They are not afraid to compete with other people.  _ Second is their self-confidence; they  are positive about themselves and their abilities. Great athletes can also deal with stress well. They are able to cut out things from their lives that add to their stress, such as unhealthy food or bad friendships. Finally, all great athletes have the mental strength to focus on what is most important. They will not let themselves be distracted (   ) from their goal. Great athletes set an example to all of us not only in how to play sports well but also in how to live life well.  1 What do all great athletes have in common?  2 How do all great athletes feel about themselves and their abilities?  3 Whatare all great athletes able to do to help handle (   ) stress?  4 What makes it possible for all great athletes to focus on what is most important?

Every four years, the Games also offer audiences a chance to get to know more about winter sports from around the world. The Winter Olympics may not have the large crowds and huge stars of its summer sibling, but they share the same Olympic spirit.  86  One of the most popular  sports of the Winter Olympic  Games is skiing. Skiers  compete in the downhill and slalom (   ) and in the short and long cross-country ski races. Skiing was originally a sport played only in cold northern countries, but now  athletes from all over the  world compete in this sport, even those from countries  without any snow!  Skaters compete with each other in speed races or in figure- skating events. The figure-skaters are generally considered to be the stars of the  Winter Olympic Games.  These ice princes and princesses are so graceful that its easy to forget that they are actually highly skilled athletes.  3 Read the text again and answer the questions.  The skeleton is one of the strangest- named sports of the Olympics. The skeleton is named after the shape of the metal sleds used in the 1890s, when the sport first started. The skeleton is a downhill sled race, usually on ice. This sport looks a little like the luge (    #), where a person sits on the back of the sled with his or her feet forward, but the skeleton is a lot more exciting and dangerous than that. In the skeleton,  a person lies on his or her stomach on the sled, with his or her head pointing downhill!  1 Whatis the summer sibling of the Winter Olympics?

The seven-game series is played in October or November and attracts a great number of fans. Baseball is one of Americas favourite sports and has many traditions, such as the seventh-inning stretch (     ).

The earthquake that hit San Francisco on April 18  shook down hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of walls and chimneys ( %4 # ). But the fire that followed burned up hundreds of millions of  dollars worth of buildings and homes. Never before in history has a city been so completely  destroyed. San Francisco is gone. The factories, the great stores and newspaper buildings, the hotels, and the great houses of the rich are all gone.  On Wednesday morning at a quarter past five came the earthquake. A moment later, the disaster was a fact. South of Market Street, in the working-class neighbourhoods and in the factories, fires started. Within an hour of the first quake, the smoke could be seen 100 miles away. The sun was red in the dark sky. There was no stopping the fires. The firefighters to whom the task was given did their best but there was no way to organise or communicate. The railway tracks were  now useless and there was no water in water pipes. All of the ways man had made to keep the city safe were gone in the 30 seconds the earth moved.  By Wednesday afternoon, half the heart of the city was gone. At that time, I watched the disaster from a ship on the bay (  ). Out at sea it was calm. No wind came up. Yet from every directioneast, west, north, and southstrong winds blew upon the unlucky city and those whose homes had once stood in its green hills.  Wednesday night saw the destruction of the very heart of the city. Man himself had to make ruins of some of the citys best buildings so that they would not be a danger to those in the streets. Tens of thousands who had lost their homes left the city to look for shelter from the fires. Some were dressed only in blankets and carried the things that they had been able to rescue  from the fires. But there were no fights and no pushing or shoving. Somehow this worst of disasters brought out the  best in the survivors. Never in all of San Franciscos history were her people so kind as on this night of terror.  - - UNIT4 NATURAL DISASTERS    2 Read the text again and answer the questions.  1 Which was more destructive, the earthquake or the fire?

WORKBOOK     a -  * Expanding Your World  CHINA TO THE RESCUE!  The China International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR) was formed in 2001 and is now made up of several hundred rescue workers and about 20 sniffer dogs. The team brings help and hope to those whose lives are changed by a storm, flood, earthquake, or any other natural disaster.  After long and careful training, the team went on its first international rescue missions in 2003. That year, the Chinese team helped save lives after earthquakes in Algeria ( ) and Iran ( #4). It was the first time that a Chinese team had worked outside China, and the team won high praise for their bravery and skill.  Since then, the CISAR has completed many missions. The list of people to whom help has been given is long. The team treated more than 38,000 people who were injured in the 2006 earthquake in Indonesia, helped 2,500 wounded people after the earthquake that hit Haiti ( #  ) in 2010, and spent several months giving aid to over 25,000 victims of the 2010 floods in Pakistan (  ) .  Rescue workers are trained to find people, treat injuries, and hand out food, water and other supplies. They have to be able to do work that is difficult under conditions which can be very dangerous. After a disaster, there is usually no electricity or water, and there may be diseases and accidents. Rescue workers get to save lives, but they must also bury the dead. That means they have to be strong in both body and mind.  Rescue workers must have big hearts, too. It takes a lot of love and courage to risk ones own life to save someone elses. The members of the CISAR have plenty of both and are always ready to go wherever help is needed.  94  UNIT5 ~~  1 Read the definitions of each word below.

POLYGLOTS:  WHAT ARE THEY AND WHO CAN BE ONE? jj  Some polyglots, who can speak quite a few languages, may seem especially talented. Zhao Yuanren, a Chinese American linguist, could speak seven languages and more than 80 dialects. Englands Queen Elizabeth | could speak about 10 languages. A famous Italian named Guiseppe Mezzofanti was reported to have been able to communicate in 30 to 40 languages. Polyglots are indeed amazing, but American teenager Tim Doner is living proof that anyone can try to be one.  As a child, Tim studied French and Latin at school, but he found it difficult to be interested in just words and grammar rules. When he was 13, Tim started listening to Hebrew rap music. One day, he looked up the words in a dictionary and realised he could put them together to make sentences! He started looking for people who spoke Hebrew so he could practise, and then, he decided to sign up for a summer Arabic class. One evening, just for fun, he posted a video of himself speaking Arabic and another of him speaking Hebrew. Hebrew and Arabic speakers wrote nice comments on his videos and gave him advice. Tim loved it. He could actually communicate with people! After that, Tim started looking for new languages to learn, and posting more videos of himself speaking new languages, including Chinese. Tim also began to use many other methods to make learning fun.  Tim wishes everyone would learn more than one language and not just as a school subject. Knowing a language is a lot more than knowing a couple of words out of a dictionary, Tim says. Languages are for communicating with people, learning about their culture, and understanding how different people think. Open up your mind to the fact that language represents a cultural world view, says Tim. You can translate words easily, but you cant quite translate meaning. Or, as Nelson Mandela said, If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.

And yet this book keeps being printedand it keeps growing! At its last printing, it was 20 volumes, with nearly 22,000 pages. This strangely popular book is one of the most famous dictionaries in the English- speaking world, the Oxford English Dictionary.  The Oxford English Dictionary, or OED for short, began in 1857 as just an idea of a group of people who thought the world needed an English-language dictionary to show the history of English words from 1150 CE to the present. lt wasnt until the late 1870s, however, when James Murray joined the project that it began to grow. Murray planned for a dictionary of about 6,400 pages in four volumes, completed in 10 years.  James Murray (1837-1915) did most of his work in a small metal building called the Scriptorium. That small building, hot in summer and cold in winter, was the place where Murray and his assistants collected millions of pieces of paper, each one with a word and an example sentence or phrase written on it. Murray and his assistants worked hard, but after five years they had only reached the word ant!  It was not until 1928 that the dictionary was declared complete and published: 10 volumes with over 400,000 words and phrases. James Murray did not live to see the completion of his lifes work; he passed away in 1915, over a decade before the OED came out.  As soon as the dictionary was published, however, the editors started to update it! in 1933, the Oxford English Dictionary was reprinted in 12 volumes. Between 1972 and 1986, four more volumes were added with new technical and scientific vocabulary and words from other English-speaking countries, such as Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In 1989, the entire dictionary was reprinted in 20 volumes! Three years later, all 20 volumes were put onto CD-ROM, and the entire dictionary is available online today.  With about 600,000 words and three million quotations from over 1,000 years of English,  the OED not only is a record of where the English language has come from but has also become an important part of the history of English-speaking cultures around the world.  100 Appendices  Notes   Unit 1  Going from junior high school to senior high school is a really big challenge.                going from junior high school to senior high school                           -ng    :  Seeing is believing.
